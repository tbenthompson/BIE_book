@article{Hubbard2009,
abstract = {The Longmen Shan mountain range, site of the devastating 12 May 2008 Wenchuan (M = 7.9) earthquake, defines the eastern margin of the Himalayan orogen and exhibits greater topographic relief than anywhere else in the Tibetan plateau. However, before the earthquake, geodetic and geologic surveys measured little shortening across the range front, inspiring a vigorous debate about the process by which the topography of the mountain belt is produced and maintained. Two endmember models have been proposed: (1) brittle crustal thickening, in which thrust faults with large amounts of slip that are rooted in the lithosphere cause uplift, and (2) crustal flow, in which low-viscosity material in the lower crust extrudes outward from the Tibetan plateau and inflates the crust north and east of the Himalayas. Here we use balanced geologic cross-sections to show that crustal shortening, structural relief, and topography are strongly correlated in the range front. This suggests that crustal shortening is a primary driver for uplift and topography of the Longmen Shan on the flanks of the plateau. The 2008 Wenchuan (M = 7.9) earthquake, which ruptured a large thrust fault along the range front causing tens of thousands of fatalities and widespread damage, is an active manifestation of this shortening process.},

@article{Kirby2007,
abstract = {Whether strike-slip fault systems in Eurasia accomplish eastward extrusion of Tibetan crust and lithosphere depends largely on the kinematics of deformation at the fault tip. Here we present new slip rate determinations using millennial-scale geomorphic markers from sites along the easternmost segment of the Kunlun fault in north central Tibet. This fault system represents one of the major strike-slip faults within the Indo-Asian collision zone, has been argued to exhibit uniform slip rates along much of its length, and plays a central role in models for eastward extrusion of Tibetan lithosphere. Displaced fluvial terrace risers along tributaries of the Yellow River, coupled with 14C ages of terrace material, provide constraints on slip rates over late Pleistocene to Holocene time. Results indicate that slip rates decrease systematically along the eastern ∼150 km of the fault from >10 to <2 mm/yr. These data challenge the view that slip along the Kunlun fault remains uniform along the entire length of the fault and instead reveal gradients in displacement similar to those expected at fault tips. Moreover, slip along the fault appears to terminate within the thickened crust of the plateau, and therefore any extrusion of Tibetan lithosphere accomplished by slip along the Kunlun fault must be absorbed by internal deformation of the plateau surrounding the fault tip.},

@article{Fialko2005a,
abstract = {Our understanding of the earthquake process requires detailed insights into how the tectonic stresses are accumulated and released on seismogenic faults. We derive the full vector displacement field due to the Bam, Iran, earthquake of moment magnitude 6.5 using radar data from the Envisat satellite of the European Space Agency. Analysis of surface deformation indicates that most of the seismic moment release along the 20-km-long strike-slip rupture occurred at a shallow depth of 4-5 km, yet the rupture did not break the surface. The Bam event may therefore represent an end-member case of the 'shallow slip deficit' model, which postulates that coseismic slip in the uppermost crust is systematically less than that at seismogenic depths (4-10 km). The InSAR-derived surface displacement data from the Bam and other large shallow earthquakes suggest that the uppermost section of the seismogenic crust around young and developing faults may undergo a distributed failure in the interseismic period, thereby accumulating little elastic strain.},
