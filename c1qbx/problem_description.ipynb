    "# Problems in numerical earthquake modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Last updated Sept 9th, 2021. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many many interesting problems to work on in the world of earthquake modeling and simulation. This page is intended to explain some of the interesting topics to software and numerics experts outside the field and is intended to be continually updated. Currently, it is mostly unfinished with some sections completely blank and it is too light on literature review.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the moment, the tooling is a major limitation for the field. Improving both the algorithms and the software would be a very productive contribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, boundary integral equation (BIE) methods are very promising for a set of problems where the object under study is itself a boundary! So, let's focus on boundary integral (and element) methods. At the moment, the standard methodology is to use constant basis function boundary elements for [which](okada) [analytical](tdes) [solutions](qdyn) have been derived. Generally, these elements are used to represent the fault in either a fullspace or halfspace.  There are some efforts to move beyond these simple methods but those efforts have not yet panned out. The main barrier is lack of software and knowledge of appropriate algorithms. I think QBX-based integration combined with FMM or H-matrix acceleration would be very powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Target capabilities\n",
    "So, what would that hypothetical BIE software look like? Let's start by just listing the types of applications that would be nice to tackle, starting with \"absolutely critical\" down to \"nice to have\".\n",
    "\n",
    "* linear elasticity\n",
    "* complex realistic geometries\n",
    "    * faults\n",
    "    * topography\n",
    "    * material interfaces\n",
    "    * fault roughness \n",
    "* large models (large enough that $O(n^2)$ methods won't work)\n",
    "* high performance\n",
    "* earthquake rupture modeling\n",
    "* linear and nonlinear viscoelastic behavior\n",
    "* elastic-plastic behavior\n",
    "* seismic waves\n",
    "\n",
    "This list is probably biased to my personal preferences and the things I've worked on so far, but also covers a huge range of problems. Solving even two or three of these bullet points would be a huge contribution!\n",
    "\n",
    "## A starting point!\n",
    "\n",
    "As an initial application of QBX/FMM methodology, I would propose working on a 2D antiplane earthquake rupture problem. A useful starting reference would be \"Quasi‚Äêdynamic versus fully dynamic simulations of earthquakes and aseismic slip with and without enhanced coseismic weakening\" by Thomas and others. I'd especially recommend sections 2.1 and 2.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic model that has been used in the past here is that of a horizontally infinite half-space free surface above a out-of-plane infinite strike slip fault. Bear with me if these words aren't making sense. In this \"antiplane shear\" setting, the Navier equations of elasticity reduce to the Poisson equation. Combining this with fault frictional ODEs into a DAE system, we get an exciting but fairly simple time dependent model of earthquakes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the details of the geometry. There are two main surfaces:\n",
    "- The free surface. We assume that the atmosphere applies negligible force on the surface of the Earth. As a result, the traction on the surface is zero. Or in Poisson-speak, the potential gradient is zero. The infinite free surface, is of course problematic in a numerical setting and must be made finite. \n",
    "  - One approach is to just truncate the flat surface. However that introduces some problems because the domain is no longer closed. \n",
    "  - Another approach is to adopt a more realistic geometry and simply use an Earth-sized circle for the free surface. That also introduces problems because the length-scale of the Earth is much much larger than that of most fault systems. \n",
    "  - A third approach is to truncate the domain with some physically-justifiable far-field vertical and basal boundary conditions - basically replace the half-space with a box. This is probably the best approach in many situations, but it does require being very careful about those far-field boundary conditions. Also, doing this in a naive way will introduce some numerically annoying corners from the corners of the box. Smoothing out those corners makes the numerics easier!\n",
    "- The fault. Here, we will be updating some ODEs in order to compute the slip rate. Slip on a fault is earthquake-speak for crack displacement. See below in the \"Background\" section for an explanation of how to deal with cracks in a BIE approach to elasticity. "

    "For many methods, the fault introduces a lot of difficulties because of the need to integrate a hypersingular kernel. QBX-based integration has none of those problems. However, there is a critical problem, *What do we do about the fault-surface intersection?* This seems closely related with corner-handling in parametrized curves. However, it actually seems a bit easier because there is no singular physical behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's return to those ODEs that we are integrating on the fault. [I wrote an accessible introduction to a common form of fault friction here](https://tbenthompson.com/post/block_slider/) This type of *rate and state friction* is a common framework for frictional earthquake modeling. For more info, \"Laboratory-Derived Friction Laws and Their Application to Seismic Faulting\" by Chris Marone is a useful review that covers a lot of the study of fault friction. However, going into too much depth is probably not necessary initially. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, in pseudocode, an earthquake simulation will often look something like this, alternating between solving the PDEs for elasticity and solving the fault-frictional equations:\n",
    "```\n",
    "while not done:\n",
    "    slip += velocity * dt\n",
    "    fault_traction = elastic_solver(slip)\n",
    "    velocity = friction_solver(fault_traction)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Test problems\n",
    "I don't know of any analytical solutions for this type of earthquake simulation, but there are several useful testing avenues:\n",
    "- The elastic solver can be thoroughly tested. There are a wide variety of idealized elasticity solutions. \n",
    "  - The analytical solutions for the displacement from a constant amount of slip on a line segment, triangle or rectangular are available. These are called \"dislocation solutions\" and are common building blocks for boudnary element methods. For line segments, see chapter 2 of \"Earthquake and Volcano Deformation\" by Paul Segall. In 3Dtriangles, see [the software here](https://github.com/tbenthompson/cutde) and the paper referenced there. \n",
    "  - The solution for slip on a line segment in a 2D model is particularly useful. I replicated [it using QBX-based BIE methods here](https://tbenthompson.com/book/c1qbx/part3_topo_solver.html). One specific solution that is very useful is exactly \n",
    "  - Another useful solution is that of a compressed sphere. Solutions for this problem and other similar \"elementary elasticity\" problems can be found in \"Theory of Elasticity\" by Timoshenko and Goodier. That book is a treasure trove of useful analytical test problems. \n",
    "- Several extensions of the elastic solver can be tested in special cases, for example, if the deeper regions are visco-elastic instead of elastic. \n",
    "- There is a project, \"The SCEC Sequences of Earthquakes and Aseismic Slip Project\" that is a community to benchmark earthquake simulation software solutions against each other. While that doesn't prove that any particular piece of software is correct, it does help to identify errors. \n",
    "- I've been working on an implementation of body force handling which would enable *method of manufactured solutions* testing."

    "\n",
    "The space of possibilities is huge, but I think the most exciting potential research is in geometrically realistic modeling of actual fault systems. Simulating the interaction of many faults at once would be a powerful demonstration of methodological capabilities and also have real scientific value. It would also provide a foundation for connecting a lot more empirical and observational evidence into theoretical models. \n",

    "Another area of personal interest is evaluating Lyapunov time scales for chaotic behavior in an earthquake system as a function of different parameters and physics. This would be foundational work in the study of whether earthquakes are predictable or not. "

Boundary element methods using rectangular or triangular dislocations \\citep{liu2005aseismic, segall2012slow} have the aforementioned stress singularity issues, especially on nonplanar faults. Both Fourier and dislocation approaches struggle with rheologies beyond linear elasticity. In comparison, finite difference methods or finite element methods can successfully model a much wider range of rheologies including non-uniform material properties \\citep{erickson2014efficient} or viscoplasticity \\citep{allison2018earthquake}.

The friction equations are then solved for the current slip velocity using Equation (\\ref{ratestate}). The state derivatives are calculated using Equation (\\ref{stateevolution}). Finally, having both the slip deficit derivatives and state derivatives, we integrate in time. The algorithm is flexible to the particular time integration method.
