    "There are many many interesting problems to work on in the world of earthquake modeling and simulation. This page is intended to explain some of the interesting topics to software and numerics experts outside the field and is intended to be continually updated. Currently, it is mostly unfinished with some sections completely blank and it is too light on literature review.\n",

    "In particular, boundary integral equation (BIE) methods are very promising for a set of problems where the object under study is itself a boundary! So, let's focus on boundary integral (and element) methods. At the moment, the standard methodology is to use constant basis function boundary elements for [which](okada) [analytical](tdes) [solutions](qdyn) have been derived. Generally, these elements are used to represent the fault in either a fullspace or halfspace.  There are some efforts to move beyond these simple methods but those efforts have not yet panned out. The main barrier is that lack of software and knowledge of appropriate algorithms. \n",

Then, if we want to compute displacement or traction, we can compute the result using the above integrals of $\\phi$. This approach is called the \"Displacement discontinuity method\". "

Fourier domain convolution methods are extremely efficient for planar faults with a uniform discretization \\citep{rice1993spatio, lapusta2000elastodynamic}. However, these methods break down in the face of any non-planarity. Similarly, boundary element methods using rectangular or triangular dislocations \\citep{liu2005aseismic, segall2012slow} have the aforementioned stress singularity issues, especially on nonplanar faults. Both Fourier and dislocation approaches struggle with rheologies beyond linear elasticity. In comparison, finite difference methods or finite element methods can successfully model a much wider range of rheologies including non-uniform material properties \\citep{erickson2014efficient} or viscoplasticity \\citep{allison2018earthquake}. However, finite difference methods still have difficulty with complex nonplanar fault geometries. In comparison, our boundary element methods can model arbitrary nonplanar fault geometries.\n",

Then, at each time step, we calculate the traction on the fault surface from the slip deficit field using Tectosaur to solve the static elastic equations. The friction equations are then solved for the current slip velocity using Equation (\\ref{ratestate}). The state derivatives are calculated using Equation (\\ref{stateevolution}). Finally, having both the slip deficit derivatives and state derivatives, we integrate in time. The algorithm is flexible to the particular time integration method. A popular method has been to use a time step dependent on the fastest slip velocity on the fault \\citep{lapusta2009three}.
