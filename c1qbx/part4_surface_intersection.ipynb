    "# Fault-surface intersection and infinite free surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is a very rough draft**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last section, we constructed a method for solving for surface displacement on a free surface given antiplane slip on a fault beneath the free surface. However, the fault was not allowed to intersect the surface of the Earth. In fact, as we will demonstrate here, if the fault had intersected the surface, the surface displacement solution would have been very wrong! In this section, we will fix this problem!\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the last section compared against an analytical solution that assumes an infinite free surface. Unfortunately, we weren't able to match the analytical solution exactly because it's hard to approximate an infinite free surface. It would be easy to stop there and make a compelling argument that the numerical method is working just fine since the error was quite low away from the tips of the free surface. But that didn't leave me satisfied. I want to fit the arctan solution as exactly as possible!\n",
    "\n",
    "So, our goals in this section are to:\n",
    "1. Model a fault that intersects the surface of the Earth.\n",
    "2. Model an infinite free surface to the best of our ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these goals will lead to more general methods that are useful for a wide range of problems. In particular, modeling an infinite free surface will force us to implement some **adaptive meshing** tools that will be very useful for other problems where the spatial scale of interest varies widely through the domain."

    "## Panels\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to solving both these problem will be to separate the surface into many smaller components that we will call \"panels\". Up until now, every surface we've dealt with has been parameterized with a single curve and then discretized using a single quadrature rule, either Gaussian or trapezoidal. Why does separating this single surface into subcomponents help?\n",
    "1. A Gaussian quadrature rule implicitly assumes that the function being integrated is smooth. However, at a fault-surface intersection, the surface displacement will actually be discontinuous! \n",
    "2. The resolution needed near the fault will be high. The resolution needed 100 fault lengths away from the fault trace is very low. So, we will need to have higher point density in some places than others. We will achieve this by refining some panels to be much smaller than others. \n",
