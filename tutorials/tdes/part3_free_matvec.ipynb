    "[In the previous section, I explained how to directly discretize a free surface using TDEs](sa_tdes). A downside of this approach is that the surface matrix can get very large very quickly. If I make the width of an element half as large, then there will be 2x many elements per dimension and 4x as many elements overall. And because the interaction matrix is dense, 4x as many elements leads to 16x as many matrix entries. In other words, $n$, the number of elements, scales like $O(h^2)$ in terms of the element width $h$. And the number of matrix rows or columns is exactly $3n$ (the 3 comes from the vector nature of the problem). That requires storing $9n^2$ entries. And, even worse, using a direct solver (LU decomposition, Gaussian elimination, etc) with such a matrix requires time like $O(n^3)$. Even for quite small problems with 10,000 elements, the cost of storage and solution get very large. And without an absolutely enormous machine or a distributed parallel implementation, solving a problem with 200,000 elements will just not be possible. On the other hand, in an ideal world, it would be nice to be able to solve problems with millions or even tens or hundreds of millions of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamentally, the problem is that the interaction matrix is dense. There are two approaches for resolving this problem:\n",
    "1. Don't store the matrix!\n",
    "2. Compress the matrix by taking advantage of low rank sub-blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually approach #2 will be critical since it is scalable up to very large problems. And that's exactly what I'll do in the next sections where I'll investigate low-rank methods and hierarchical matrices (H-matrices). However, here, I'll demonstrate approach #1 by using a matrix-free iterative solver. Ultimately, this is just a small patch on a big problem and it won't be a sustainable solution. But, it's immediately useful when you don't have a working implementation, are running into RAM constraints and are okay with a fairly slow solution. It's also useful to introduce iterative linear solvers since they are central to solving BEM linear systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we solve a linear system without storing the matrix, [the method is called \"matrix-free\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix-free_methods). Generally, we'll just recompute any matrix entry whenever we need. How does this do algorithmically? The storage requirements drop to just the $O(n)$ source and observation info instead of the $O(n^2)$ dense matrix. And, as I'll demonstrate, for some problems, the runtime will drop to $O(n^2)$ instead of $O(n^3)$ because solving linear systems will be possible with a fixed and fairly small number of matrix-vector products.\n",

    "To get started, I'll just copy the code to set up the linear system for the South America problem from the previous section. But, as a twist, I'll going to use a mesh with several times more elements. This surface mesh has 28,388 elements. As a result, the matrix would have 3x that many rows and columns and would require 58 GB of memory to store. That's still small enough that it could be stored on a medium sized workstation. But, it's too big for my personal computer!"

Because our columns come from integrals over elements but our rows come from observation points, there is an inherent asymmetry to the boundary element matrices we are producing here.

    "## Performance and convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "An important thing to note about the solution above is that only a few matrix-vector products are required to get to a high-level of accuracy. GMRES (and many other iterative linear and nonlinear optimization algorithms) converges at a rate proportional to the condition number of the matrix {cite:p}`Saad1986`. So in order to productively use an iterative linear solver, we need to have a matrix with a small condition number. It turns out that these free surface self-interaction matrices have condition numbers that are very close to 1.0, meaning that all the eigenvalues are very similar in magnitude. As a result, a highly accurate solution with GMRES requires less than ten matrix-vector products even for very large matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this dependence on the condition number, in the worst case, iterative solvers are not faster than a direct solver. However, suppose that we need only 10 matrix-vector products. Then, the runtime is approximately $10(2n^2)$ because each matrix-vector product requires $2n^2$ operations (one multiplication and one addition per matrix entry). As a result, GMRES is solving the problem in $O(n^2)$ instead of the $O(n^3)$ asymptotic runtime of direct methods like LU decomposition. So, in addition to requiring less memory, the matrix free method here forced us into actually using a faster linear solver. Of course, LU decomposition comes out ahead again if we need to solve many linear systems with the same left hand side and different right hand sides. That is not the case here but would be relevant for many other problems (e.g. problems involving time stepping).\n",
