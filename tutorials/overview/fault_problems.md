# [DRAFT] Common computational modeling problems in earthquake science

The world of geophysics and earthquake science has a huge range of modeling problems. The spatial scales span from the nanometer and micrometer behavior of rock mechanics and friction to the thousands of kilometers on the global scale. The temporal scales span from micro or millisecond behavior inside a fault zone to seconds/minutes during an earthquake to hundreds of years during the interseismic period all the way to millions of years for plate tectonics motions. Physics varies wildly: elastic waves, friction, pore-fluid flow, plastic failure, viscous flow.

## Some common problems

This is a brief list of some interesting types of problems that people might want to work with.

### Seismic inversion

The goal here is normally to infer properites about the deep Earth by using observations of the seismic wave field.
- the main behavior of interest are elastic waves. These are essentially sound waves traveling through a solid.
- the sources of these waves are normally from earthquake and volcanoes. But, there are lots of other sources that people are sometimes interested in: intentional thumps or explosion in exploration geophysics, nuclear weapons for monitoring purposes, traffic sounds, and many more.
- the stresses involved are quite small, except very close to the wave source.
- the time scales are generally a few milliseconds up to a few minutes, but might range up to days when looking at low order spherical harmonic modes.

### Earthquake rupture dynamics
- the main behavior of interest is the interaction of friction on a fault with the elastic and plastic behavior of the surrounding rock.
- the stresses under consideration are much larger than in seismic inversion because the moving rupture front can produce very high dynamic stresses.
- the time scales are similar to those of seismic inversion: milliseconds up to minutes.
-

### Earthquake cycle simulation
- the two core behaviors of interest are the

### Tectonic processes

The goal here is normally to understand the behavior of some component of plate tectonics.
- the main behavior is often either faulting or viscoplastic simplification of bulk crustal deformation.
- large stresses abound and handling those large stresses is a major part of the problem. The physics of brittle and ductile crustal failure over a long time frame are unsettled.
- the time scale can range from a few years to a few million years.
