  abstract = {We simulate dynamic ruptures on a strike-slip fault in homogeneous and layered half-spaces and on a thrust fault in a layered half-space. With traditional friction models, sliding friction exceeds 50\% of the fault normal compressive stress, and unless the pore pressures approach the lithostatic stress, the rupture characteristics depend strongly on the depth, and sliding generates large amounts of heat. Under application of reasonable stress distributions with depth, variation of the effective coefficient of friction with the square root of the shear modulus and the inverse of the depth creates distributions of stress drop and fracture energy that produce realistic rupture behavior. This ad hoc friction model results in (1) low-sliding friction at all depths and (2) fracture energy that is relatively independent of depth. Additionally, friction models with rate-weakening behavior (which form pulselike ruptures) appear to generate heterogeneity in the distributions of final slip and shear stress more effectively than those without such behavior (which form cracklike ruptures). For surface rupture on a thrust fault, the simple slip-weakening friction model, which lacks rate-weakening behavior, accentuates the dynamic interactions between the seismic waves and the rupture and leads to excessively large ground motions on the hanging wall. Waveforms below the center of the fault (which are associated with waves radiated to teleseismic distances) indicate that source inversions of thrust events may slightly underestimate the slip at shallow depths.},

  abstract = {Fast multipole methods (FMM) on distributed memory have traditionally used a bulk-synchronous model of communicating the local essential tree (LET) and overlapping it with computation of the local data. This could be perceived as an extreme case of data aggregation, where the whole LET is communicated at once. Charm++ allows a much finer control over the granularity of communication, and has a asynchronous execution model that fits well with the structure of our FMM code. Unlike previous work on asynchronous fast N-body methods such as ChaNGa and PEPC, the present work performs a direct comparison against the traditional bulk-synchronous approach and the asynchronous approach using Charm++. Furthermore, the serial performance of our FMM code is over an order of magnitude better than these previous codes, so it is much more challenging to hide the overhead of Charm++.},

  abstract = {The numerical method of Helsing and co-workers evaluates Laplace and related layer potentials generated by a panel (composite) quadrature on a curve, efficiently and with high-order accuracy for arbitrarily close targets. Since it exploits complex analysis, its use has been restricted to two dimensions (2D). We first explain its loss of accuracy as panels become curved, using a classical complex approximation result of Walsh that can be interpreted as ``electrostatic shielding'' of a Schwarz singularity. We then introduce a variant that swaps the target singularity for one at its complexified parameter preimage; in the latter space the panel is flat, hence the convergence rate can be much higher. The preimage is found robustly by Newton iteration. This idea also enables, for the first time, a near-singular quadrature for potentials generated by smooth curves in 3D, building on recurrences of Tornberg\textendash Gustavsson. We apply this to accurate evaluation of the Stokes flow near to a curved filament in the slender body approximation. Our 3D method is several times more efficient (both in terms of kernel evaluations, and in speed in a C implementation) than the only existing alternative, namely, adaptive integration.},

  abstract = {When solving partial differential equations using boundary integral equation methods, accurate evaluation of singular and nearly singular integrals in layer potentials is crucial. A recent scheme for this is quadrature by expansion (QBX), which solves the problem by locally approximating the potential using a local expansion centered at some distance from the source boundary. In this paper we introduce an extension of the QBX scheme in two dimensions (2D) denoted AQBX---adaptive quadrature by expansion---which combines QBX with an algorithm for automated selection of parameters, based on a target error tolerance. A key component in this algorithm is the ability to accurately estimate the numerical errors in the coefficients of the expansion. Combining previous results for flat panels with a procedure for taking the panel shape into account, we derive such error estimates for arbitrarily shaped boundaries in 2D that are discretized using panel-based Gauss--Legendre quadrature. Applying our scheme to numerical solutions of Dirichlet problems for the Laplace and Helmholtz equations, and also for solving these equations, we find that the scheme is able to satisfy a given target tolerance to within an order of magnitude, making it useful for practical applications. This represents a significant simplification over the original QBX algorithm, in which choosing a good set of parameters can be hard.},

Quadrature by expansion (QBX) is a new method for dealing with such integrals, and it is based on forming a local expansion of the layer potential close to the boundary. In doing so, one introduces a new quadrature error due to nearly singular integration in the evaluation of expansion coefficients. Using a method based on contour integration and calculus of residues, the quadrature error of nearly singular integrals can be accurately estimated. This makes it possible to derive accurate estimates for the quadrature errors related to QBX, when applied to layer potentials in two and three dimensions. As examples we derive estimates for the Laplace and Helmholtz single layer potentials. These results can be used for parameter selection in practical applications.},

In this work we present a fast and accurate framework for simulating spheroids in periodic Stokes flow, which is based on the completed double layer boundary integral formulation. The framework implements a new method known as quadrature by expansion (QBX), which uses surrogate local expansions of the layer potential to evaluate it to very high accuracy both on and off the particle surfaces. This quadrature method is accelerated through a newly developed precomputation scheme. The long range interactions are computed using the spectral Ewald (SE) fast summation method, which after integration with QBX allows the resulting system to be solved in M log M time, where M is the number of particles. This framework is suitable for simulations of large particle systems, and can be used for studying e.g. porous media models.},

In particular, the divergence-free condition and boundary conditions are handled naturally, and the ill-conditioning caused by high order terms in the PDE is preconditioned analytically. Despite these advantages, the adoption of integral equation methods has been slow due to a number of difficulties in their implementation. This work describes a complete integral equation-based flow solver that builds on recently developed methods for singular quadrature and the solution of PDEs on complex domains, in combination with several more well-established numerical methods. We apply this solver to flow problems on a number of geometries, both simple and challenging, studying its convergence properties and computational performance. This serves as a demonstration that it is now relatively straightforward to develop a robust, efficient, and flexible Navier-Stokes solver, using integral equation methods.},

These methods are complementary: velocity gradients are purely kinematic and yield information about regional deformation; the calculation does not take into account either faults or rigid blocks but, where GNSS data are dense enough, active fault zones and stable blocks emerge naturally in the solution. Block modeling integrates known structural geometry with idealized earthquake cycle models to predict slip rates on active faults. Future technological advances should overcome many of today's uncertainties and provide rich new data to mine by providing denser, more uniform, and temporally continuous observations.},

The highlight of this new fast direct solver is that the solver scales linearly in the number of unknowns in all dimensions. The solver, termed as Inverse Fast Multipole Method (abbreviated as IFMM), works on the same data-structure as the Fast Multipole Method (abbreviated as FMM). More generally, the solver can be immediately extended to the class of hierarchical matrices, denoted as H2 matrices with strong admissibility criteria (weak low-rank structure), i.e., the interaction between neighboring cluster of particles is full-rank whereas the interaction between particles corresponding to well-separated clusters can be efficiently represented as a low-rank matrix. The algorithm departs from existing approaches in the fact that throughout the algorithm the interaction corresponding to neighboring clusters are always treated as full-rank interactions. Our approach relies on two major ideas: (i) The N \texttimes{} N matrix arising out of FMM (from now on termed as FMM matrix) can be represented as an extended sparser matrix of size M \texttimes{} M , where M {$\approx$} 3N . (ii) While solving the larger extended sparser matrix, the fill-in's that arise in the matrix blocks corresponding to well-separated clusters are hierarchically compressed. The ordering of the equations and the unknowns in the extended sparser matrix is strongly related to the local and multipole coefficients in the FMM [33] and the order of elimination is different from the usual nested dissection approach. Numerical benchmarks on 2D manifold confirm the linear scaling of the algorithm.},

This method rewrites the system of elastoplasticity non-linear equations in a form adapted to the fixed-point method. The second algorithm relates to the computation of the elastoplastic consistent tangent matrix using a simple finite difference scheme. A first validation is performed on a nonlinear bar problem. The results obtained show that both numerical algorithms are very efficient and yield the exact solution. The proposed algorithms are applied to a two-dimensional rockfill dam loaded in plane strain. The elastoplastic tangent matrix is calculated by using the finite difference scheme for Mohr\textendash Coulomb's constitutive law. The results obtained with the developed algorithms are very close to those obtained via the commercial software PLAXIS. It should be noted that the algorithm's code, developed under the Matlab environment, offers the possibility of modeling the construction phases (i.e., building layer by layer) by activating the different layers according to the imposed loading. This algorithmic and implementation framework allows to easily integrate other laws of nonlinear behaviors, including the Hardening Soil Model.},

  abstract = {We study in-plane ruptures on a bimaterial fault governed by a velocity-weakening friction with a regularized normal stress response. Numerical simulations and analytical estimates provide characterization of the ranges of velocity-weakening scales, nucleation lengths and background stresses for which ruptures behave as cracks or pulses, decaying or sustained, bilateral or unilateral. With strongly velocity-weakening friction, ruptures occur under a wide range of conditions as large-scale pulses with a preferred propagation direction, that of slip of the more compliant material. Such ruptures have macroscopic asymmetry manifested by significantly larger seismic potency and propagation distance in the preferred direction, and clearly quantified by the directivity ratio derived from the second order moments of the spatio-temporal distribution of slip rate. The macroscopic rupture asymmetry of the large-scale pulses stems from the difference in the criticality conditions for self-sustained propagation in each rupture direction, induced by the asymmetric normal stress changes operating in bimaterial interfaces. In contrast, crack-like ruptures show macroscopic asymmetry under restrictive conditions. The discussed mechanism is robust with respect to regularization parameters, ranges of stress heterogeneities and a proxy for off-fault yielding, and should operate similarly for crustal-scale rupture pulses even in the absence of velocity-weakening. Small-scale pulses, driven by the bimaterial normal stress reduction at the scale of the process zone, can detach from the rupture front of the large-scale pulses that propagate in the preferred direction. However, their occurrence depends on the relaxation scale in the regularization of the normal stress response and their development can be hindered by off-fault yielding.},

The problem of dynamic frictional contact along slip interfaces in elastic domains is formulated in a hybrid variational form, with Lagrange multipliers associated to the fault tractions. The problem is discretized in space by a spectral element method and in time by a second order finite difference time scheme. We investigate the convergence of the numerical error with grid refinement in canonical test cases. We study in detail the origin and nature of the high frequency numerical noise as well as different solutions to reduce it. Comparisons with other methods on a standard convergence test show that the spectral element method for fault dynamics is very accurate and competitive. The ability of the method to handle rupture problems with realistic geometries, fault zone structure and non-linear off-fault rheology is illustrated through several examples.},

In a recent work for the standard (singular) boundary integral equation, the volume term was decomposed into an easily computed boundary integral, plus a remainder volume integral with a modified source function. The key feature of this modified function is that it is everywhere zero on the boundary. In this work it is shown that the same basic approach is successful for the hypersingular equation, despite the stronger singularity in the domain integral. Specifically, the volume term can be directly evaluated without a body-fitted volume mesh, by means of a regular grid of cells that cover the domain. Cells that intersect the boundary are treated by continuously extending the integrand to be zero outside the domain. The method and error results for test problems are presented in terms of the three-dimensional Poisson problem, but the techniques are expected to be generally applicable.},

At present, the American and Pacific plates appear to be moving past one another parallel to the San Andreas fault at a rate of 6 cm/yr. Data concerning the late Cenozoic history of motions between these plates is inconclusive, and so 2 probable models are examined. One assumes a constant motion of 6 cm/yr throughout the late Cenozoic, whereas the other assumes that the 2 plates were fixed with respect to one another until 5 m.y. ago, at which time they broke along the San Andreas fault system and began moving at 6 cm/yr. The second model implies that the San Andreas fault took up all the motion at the boundary between the North American and Pacific plates, while the first model suggests the broader view that much of che late Cenozoic tectonic activity of western North America is related to this boundary de:;ormation. The models make testable predictions for the distribution of igneous rocks and ror the total amount and timing of deformation expected. Extrapolation of the model of constant motions to the early Cenozoic suggests an era of slightly compressional strike-slip at the edge of North America. A major change in plate motions in late Mesozoic time is suggested.},

In this method, the forward error tends to concentrate in the direction of a singular vector corresponding to {$\sigma$}min. Extensive experiments show that the method is reliable. It is often much faster than a dense SVD and it can sometimes estimate the condition number when running a dense SVD would be impractical due to the computational cost or the memory requirements. The method uses very little memory (it inherits this property from LSQR) and it works equally well on square and rectangular matrices.},

Forty-four terranes are distinguished and classi\textregistered ed into cratonal, metamorphic, passive margin, island arc, forearc/backarc, accretionary complex, or ophiolitic types. New detailed stratigraphic columns for all terranes are presented which summarize the geological evolution of each terrane. Our analysis reveals that small Precambrian cratonic blocks in the Hangay region acted as a central nucleus around which Paleozoic arcs, backarc/forearc basin assemblages, associated subduction complexes and continental slivers were accreted. The temporal and spatial order of accretion and amalgamation was complex and probably not simply from north to south with time. The timing of terrane accretion is partly constrained by sedimentary overlap assemblages and post-amalgamation intrusive complexes. The main stages of amalgamation occurred during the Neoproterozoic, Cambrian{$\pm$}Ordovician, Devonian, Pennsylvanian{$\pm$}Permian and Triassic. The arcuate trends of terranes around the central Hangay region provide the \textregistered rst-order structural grain for Mongolia. This crustal anisotropy has played a major role in controlling the geometry and kinematics of all subsequent Phanerozoic deformation and reactivation of structures in the region, including the Cenozoic development of the Altai and Gobi Altai. Our results provide the most detailed synthesis to date of the basement geology of Mongolia which should provide an important crustal framework for interpreting the Phanerozoic tectonic evolution of a large part of Central Asia.

The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.},

  abstract = {Substantial improvements are reported in the computational efficiency of Galerkin boundary element analysis (BEA) employing curved continuous boundary elements for elasticity problems. A direct analytical treatment of the singular and hypersingular double integrations, employing a limit to the boundary definition is adapted to gain computational economy. Symbolic manipulation has been employed to derive the analytical expressions for the singular contributions to these double integrals. The analytical regularization procedure separates the potentially singular Galerkin integrands into an essentially singular but simple part, plus a regular remainder that can be integrated numerically. The exact finite contributions from the simplified singular terms are then computed analytically. It is shown that the key to containing the explosive growth in the length of the formulae associated with such a hybrid analytical/numerical integration scheme is the strategic timing of when to take the limit to the boundary. This regularization also isolates the contribution from the curvature of the boundary element, thus facilitating enhanced computational efficiency in problems with many straight elements. Although the evaluation of the integrals of the Kelvin fundamental solution essentially follows the procedures described earlier for the scalar Laplace equation, the analytical treatment, is now more involved, in terms of the complexity and number of terms present in each of these second rank tensor kernel functions. The complete analytical formulation is explicitly provided in a series of tables. Example problems indicate that, with these techniques, Galerkin symmetric BEA can be more efficient than collocation for moderate or large scale problems.},

However, the complexity of scaling to such large machines and problem sizes has so far prevented the emergence of generic software libraries that support such computations, although these would lower the threshold of entry and enable many more applications to benefit from large-scale computing.             We are concerned with providing this functionality for mesh-adaptive finite element computations. We assume the existence of an ``oracle'' that implements the generation and modification of an adaptive mesh distributed across many processors, and that responds to queries about its structure. Based on querying the oracle, we develop scalable algorithms and data structures for generic finite element methods. Specifically, we consider the parallel distribution of mesh data, global enumeration of degrees of freedom, constraints, and postprocessing. Our algorithms remove the bottlenecks that typically limit large-scale adaptive finite element analyses.             We demonstrate scalability of complete finite element workflows on up to 16,384 processors. An implementation of the proposed algorithms, based on the open source software p4est as mesh oracle, is provided under an open source license through the widely used deal.II finite element software library.},

  abstract = {We present a new finite-element technique for calculating dynamic 3-D spontaneous rupture on an earthquake fault, which can reduce the required computational resources by a factor of six or more, without loss of accuracy. The grid-doubling technique employs small cells in a thin layer surrounding the fault. The remainder of the modelling volume is filled with larger cells, typically two or four times as large as the small cells. In the resulting non-conforming mesh, an interpolation method is used to join the thin layer of smaller cells to the volume of larger cells. Grid-doubling is effective because spontaneous rupture calculations typically require higher spatial resolution on and near the fault than elsewhere in the model volume. The technique can be applied to non-planar faults by morphing, or smoothly distorting, the entire mesh to produce the desired 3-D fault geometry. Using our FaultMod finite-element software, we have tested grid-doubling with both slip-weakening and rate-and-state friction laws, by running the SCEC/USGS 3-D dynamic rupture benchmark problems. We have also applied it to a model of the Hayward fault, Northern California, which uses realistic fault geometry and rock properties. FaultMod implements fault slip using common nodes, which represent motion common to both sides of the fault, and differential nodes, which represent motion of one side of the fault relative to the other side. We describe how to modify the traction-at-split-nodes method to work with common and differential nodes, using an implicit time stepping algorithm.},

We generalize the so-called Boussinesq's and Cerruti's problems to include a restoring buoyancy boundary condition at the surface. Buoyancy due to a large density contrast at the Earth's surface is an approximation to the full effect of gravity that neglects the perturbation of the gravitational potential and the change in density in the interior. Using the perturbation method, and assuming that the effect of gravity is small compared to the elastic deformation, we derive an approximation in the space domain to the Boussinesq's problem that accounts for a buoyancy boundary condition at the surface. The Fourier- and space-domain solutions are shown to be in good agreement. Numerous problems of elastostatic or quasi-static time-dependent deformation relevant to faulting in the Earth's interior (including inelastic deformation) can be modelled using equivalent body forces and surface tractions. Solving the governing equations with the elastic Green's function in the space domain can be impractical as the body force can be distributed over a large volume. We present a computationally efficient method to evaluate the elastic deformation in a 3-D half space due to the presence of an arbitrary distribution of internal forces and tractions at the surface of the half space. We first evaluate the elastic deformation in a periodic Cartesian volume in the Fourier domain, then use the analytic solutions to the generalized Boussinesq's and Cerruti's problems to satisfy the prescribed mixed boundary condition at the surface. We show some applications for magmatic intrusions and faulting. This approach can be used to solve elastostatic problems involving spatially heterogeneous elastic properties (by employing a homogenization method) and time-dependent problems such as non-linear viscoelastic relaxation, poroelastic rebound and non-steady fault creep under the assumption of spatially homogeneous elastic properties.},

The time-dependent relaxation that follows an earthquake, or any other static stress perturbation, is considered in a framework of a generalized viscoelastoplastic rheology whereby some inelastic strain relaxes a physical quantity in the material. The relaxed quantity is the deviatoric stress in case of viscoelastic relaxation, the shear stress in case of creep on a fault plane and the trace of the stress tensor in case of poroelastic rebound. In this framework, the instantaneous velocity field satisfies the linear inhomogeneous Navier's equation with sources parametrized as equivalent body forces and surface tractions. We evaluate the velocity field using the Fourier-domain Green's function for an elastic half-space with surface buoyancy boundary condition. The accuracy of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparisons with finite-element simulations of viscoelastic relaxation following strike-slip and dip-slip ruptures for linear and power-law rheologies. We also present comparisons with analytic solutions for afterslip driven by coseismic stress changes. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed method can be used to model time-dependent poroelastic rebound by adopting a viscoelastic rheology with bulk viscosity and work hardening. The proposed method allows one to model post-seismic transients that involve multiple mechanisms (afterslip, poroelastic rebound, ductile flow) with an account for the effects of gravity, non-linear rheologies and arbitrary spatial variations in inelastic properties of rocks (e.g. the effective viscosity, rate-and-state frictional parameters and poroelastic properties).},

Boundary-element methods (BEM) represent one popular approach to simulating models based on partial-differential equations (PDEs), and give rise to linear matrix equations. The entries associated with BEM matrices can be calculated in different ways, and in this paper we show that a straightforward approach to discretizing the widely used apparent-surface-charge (ASC) formulation is significantly less accurate than an equivalent but less obvious approach. In contrast, more computationally expensive boundaryintegral formulations based on pairs of coupled integral equations exhibit reduced sensitivity to the approach to forming the BEM matrix. We also illustrate the equivalence between the ASC formulation and the double-layer formulation derived by Juffer et al.; when their matrix entries are evaluated appropriately, the two formulations produce numerically identical solutions. A similar equivalence exists between the Yoon\textendash Lenhoff and the Bordner\textendash Huber formulations.},

It is well known that explicit finite difference or finite element schemes for the heat equation are stable only if the time step {$\increment$}t is of the order O({$\increment$}x2), where {$\increment$}x is the finest spatial grid spacing. In contrast, for the Dirichlet and Neumann problems on the unit ball in all dimensions d {$\geq$} 1, we show that the simplest Volterra marching scheme, i.e., the forward Euler scheme, is unconditionally stable. Our proof is based on an explicit spectral radius bound of the marching matrix, leading to an estimate that an L2-norm of the solution to the integral equation is bounded by cdT d/2 times the norm of the right hand side. For the Robin problem on the half space in any dimension, with constant Robin (heat transfer) coefficient {$\kappa$}, we exhibit a constant C such that the forward Euler scheme is stable if {$\increment$}t {$<$} C/{$\kappa$}2, independent of any spatial discretization. This relies on new lower bounds on the spectrum of real symmetric Toeplitz matrices defined by convex sequences.

  abstract = {In this paper, we consider band-structure calculations governed by the Helmholtz or Maxwell equations in piecewise homogeneous periodic materials. Methods based on boundary integral equations are natural in this context, since they discretize the interface alone and can achieve high order accuracy in complicated geometries. In order to handle the quasi-periodic conditions which are imposed on the unit cell, the free-space Green's function is typically replaced by its quasi-periodic cousin. Unfortunately, the quasi-periodic Green's function diverges for families of parameter values that correspond to resonances of the empty unit cell. Here, we bypass this problem by means of a new integral representation that relies on the free-space Green's function alone, adding auxiliary layer potentials on the boundary of the unit cell itself. An important aspect of our method is that by carefully including a few neighboring images, the densities may be kept smooth and convergence rapid. This framework results in an integral equation of the second kind, avoids spurious resonances, and achieves spectral accuracy. Because of our image structure, inclusions which intersect the unit cell walls may be handled easily and automatically. Our approach is compatible with fast-multipole acceleration, generalizes easily to three dimensions, and avoids the complication of divergent lattice sums.},

  abstract = {A total of 166 observations of sea-level change, 130 measurements of elevation difference, and 16 determinations of horizontal strain provide an excellent view of the (quasi-)static source process of the great 1960 Chilean earthquake. These surface deformation data were employed in classical uniform slip fault models as well as more recently developed models that allow spatial variability of slip. The best uniform slip planar (USP) model is 850km long, 130km wide, and dips 20". Seventeen metres of fault displacement contributed to a USP moment of 9.4 x ld2N m. The variable slip planar (VSP) model concentrates slip on a 900 km long, 150km wide band parallel to the coast. Several peaks of slip with dimensions of 50-100 km appear in this band and are thought to represent major subduction zone asperities. Important fractures of the oceanic lithosphere bound the 1960 rupture and are offered as a potential source of fault segmentation within the Chilean subduction zone. The VSP moment for 1960 earthquake totals 9.5 x N m, about one fifth of the value estimated for the foreshock-mainshock sequence from seismic methods. Except for areas out to sea, geodetic resolution on the fault is fairly uniform. Thus, it is unlikely that slip missed by the network could increase the VSP moment much beyond 1.8 x N m. Several patches of moment, isolated from the main body at 80-110 km depth, are found down dip in the VSP model and are presumably indicative of aseismic slip. One patch at the northern end of the rupture is probably associated with the initiation phase of the mainshock, although the time sequence of the relationship is unknown. Tide gauge records suggest that another patch between 40" and 43" S , responsible for the observed strain and uplifts inland at those latitudes, is not of coseismic origin, but derives from in-place, post-seismic creep over several years. Apparently, great 1960-type events are not typical members of the -128 yr earthquake cycle in south-central Chile. The Nazca-South America boundary here is characterized by a variable rupture mode in which major asperities are completely broken by great earthquakes only once in four or five earthquake cycles. The more frequent large earthquakes, that geographically overlap the great events, fill in between the locked zones.},

Legion is organized around logical regions, which express both locality and independence of program data, and tasks, functions that perform computations on regions. We describe a runtime system that dynamically extracts parallelism from Legion programs, using a distributed, parallel scheduling algorithm that identifies both independent tasks and nested parallelism. Legion also enables explicit, programmer controlled movement of data through the memory hierarchy and placement of tasks based on locality information via a novel mapping interface. We evaluate our Legion implementation on three applications: fluid-flow on a regular grid, a three-level AMR code solving a heat diffusion equation, and a circuit simulation.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we use observations of earthquake source parameters and gravity to investigate the mechanical properties and the active faulting of the lithosphere in Mongolia. Well-determined earthquake centroid depths, including 10 from inversions of P and SH waveforms that are presented here for the first time, show that the seismogenic thickness (Ts) within Mongolia itself is less than 20 km. However, to both the east, in parts of the Lake Baikal rift system, and the west, adjacent to the Junggar basin and Kazakhstan platform, the seismogenic thickness is considerably greater, and includes essentially the whole crust. From the admittance between the free-air gravity and the topography, and also from profiles across a flexural foreland basin, we determine the effective elastic thickness (Te) in central Mongolia to be {$<$}10 km, though it may be a little greater ({$<$}20 km) adjacent to the Gobi-Altay range in the south. Further west, adjacent to the Kazakhstan platform, the same techniques show that Te {$>$} 30 km. In both Mongolia and its surroundings, Te is comparable with Ts and, where it is well determined, Te {$<$} Ts. Nowhere do the data require that Te {$>$} Ts. These data are consistent with the view that the strength of the continental lithosphere resides in its seismogenic part, which in Mongolia is the upper crust, but to both the east and west appears to be the whole crust. The earthquake source parameters also allow us to ask how the active faulting in Mongolia accommodates the velocity field revealed by GPS measurements. It is likely that the entire Mongolian Altay range in the west rotates counter-clockwise relative to stable Asia, and is responsible for the distributed E\textendash W left-lateral shear seen further east in central Mongolia. The admittance observations show no evidence at the present day for convective mantle support, or a `hotspot', responsible for the elevated region of the Hangay dome in central Mongolia, even though the geochemical data from nodules in late Cenozoic basalts and seismic tomography studies suggest elevated temperatures at shallow depths ({$<$}125 km) and probably thinned lithosphere.},

The approach is to regularize the singularity and obtain a preliminary value from a standard quadrature rule.

We prove an error estimate for the corrected value, uniform with respect to the point of evaluation. One application is a simple method for solving the Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation on a grid covering an irregular region in the plane, similar to an earlier method of A. Mayo. This approach could also be used to compute the pressure gradient due to a force on a moving boundary in an incompressible uid. Computational examples are given for the double layer potential and for the Dirichlet problem.},

All parts of the tree-code algorithm are executed on the GPU. We present algorithms for parallel construction and traversing of sparse octrees. These algorithms are implemented in CUDA and tested on NVIDIA GPUs, but they are portable to OpenCL and can easily be used on manycore devices from other manufacturers. This portability is achieved by using general parallel-scan and sort methods. The gravitational tree-code outperforms tuned CPU code during the tree-construction and shows a performance improvement of more than a factor 20 overall, resulting in a processing rate of more than 2.8 million particles per second.},

  abstract = {Complexity theory of circuits strongly suggests that deep architectures can be much more efficient (sometimes exponentially) than shallow architectures, in terms of computational elements required to represent some functions. Deep multi-layer neural networks have many levels of non-linearities allowing them to compactly represent highly non-linear and highly-varying functions. However, until recently it was not clear how to train such deep networks, since gradient-based optimization starting from random initialization appears to often get stuck in poor solutions. Hinton et al. recently introduced a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning algorithm for Deep Belief Networks (DBN), a generative model with many layers of hidden causal variables. In the context of the above optimization problem, we study this algorithm empirically and explore variants to better understand its success and extend it to cases where the inputs are continuous or where the structure of the input distribution is not revealing enough about the variable to be predicted in a supervised task. Our experiments also confirm the hypothesis that the greedy layer-wise unsupervised training strategy mostly helps the optimization, by initializing weights in a region near a good local minimum, giving rise to internal distributed representations that are high-level abstractions of the input, bringing better generalization.},

  abstract = {Dynamic rupture of a 3-D spontaneous crack of arbitrary shape is investigated using a finite volume (FV) approach. The full domain is decomposed in tetrahedra whereas the surface, on which the rupture takes place, is discretized with triangles that are faces of tetrahedra. First of all, the elastodynamic equations are described into a pseudo-conservative form for an easy application of the FV discretization. Explicit boundary conditions are given using criteria based on the conservation of discrete energy through the crack surface. Using a stress-threshold criterion, these conditions specify fluxes through those triangles that have suffered rupture. On these broken surfaces, stress follows a linear slip-weakening law, although other friction laws can be implemented. For The Problem Version 3 of the dynamic-rupture code verification exercise conducted by the SCEC/USGS, numerical solutions on a planar fault exhibit a very high convergence rate and are in good agreement with the reference one provided by a finite difference (FD) technique. For a non-planar fault of parabolic shape, numerical solutions agree satisfactorily well with those obtained with a semi-analytical boundary integral method in terms of shear stress amplitudes, stopping phases arrival times and stress overshoots. Differences between solutions are attributed to the low-order interpolation of the FV approach, whose results are particularly sensitive to the mesh regularity (structured/unstructured). We expect this method, which is well adapted for multiprocessor parallel computing, to be competitive with others for solving large scale dynamic ruptures scenarios of seismic sources in the near future.},

After transformations for building up the partial differential system following explicit conservative law, we design an unstructured bi-dimensional time-domain numerical formulation of the crack problem.

On these complex surfaces, boundary conditions are set on stress fluxes and not on stress values. Prescribed rupture velocity gives accurate solutions with respect to analytical ones depending on the mesh refinement, while solutions for spontaneous propagation are analysed through numerical means. An example of non-planar spontaneous fault growth in heterogeneous media demonstrates the good behaviour of the proposed algorithm as well as specific difficulties of such numerical modelling.},

  abstract = {The matrix inversion of seismic data for slip distribution on finite faults is based on the formulation of the representation theorem as a linear inverse problem. The way the problem is posed and parameterized involves substantial, and often subjective, decision making. This introduces several levels of uncertainty, some of them recognized and some not adequately addressed. First, the inverse problem must be numerically stabilized and geologically constrained to obtain meaningful solutions. It is known that geologically irrelevant solutions also exist that may even better fit the data. It is also known that obtaining a stabilized, constrained solution compatible with the data does not guarantee that it is close to the true slip. Second, once the scheme has been set up, there still remains significant uncertainty in seismological parameterization. Synthetic tests have consistently shown that incorrect assumptions about the parameters fixed in the inversions, such as the rupture speed, fault geometry, or crustal structure, generate geologic artifacts, which are also dependent on array geometry. Third, solving the inverse problem involves numerical approximation of a continuous integral, with the generally grid-dependent result. Fourth, maintaining a linear inverse problem requires that the final slip on each subfault be the only variable to solve for. The slip functions used in the inversions are typically integrals of triangles or boxcars; they all involve a second parameter, slip duration, which has to be fixed. The effect of chosen duration cannot be disregarded, especially when frequencies higher than 0.1\textendash 0.5 Hz in the data are modeled. Fifth, the spectra of triangles and boxcars are sinc functions, whose relevance to realistically observed spectra is problematic.},

  abstract = {Background In oncology, the treatment paradigm is shifting toward personalized medicine, where the goal is to match patients to the treatments most likely to deliver benefit. Treatment effects in various subpopulations may provide some information about treatment effects in other subpopulations. Purpose We compare different approaches to Phase II trial design where a new treatment is being investigated in several groups of patients. We compare considering each group in an independent trial to a single trial with hierarchical modeling of the patient groups. Methods We assume four patient groups with different background response rates and simulate operating characteristics of three trial designs, Simon's Optimal TwoStage design, a Bayesian adaptive design with frequent interim analyses, and a Bayesian adaptive design with frequent interim analyses and hierarchical modeling across patient groups. Results Simon's designs are based on 10\% Type I and Type II error rates. The independent Bayesian designs are tuned to have similar error rates, but may have a slightly smaller mean sample size due to more frequent interim analyses. Under the null, the mean sample size is 2\textendash 4 patients smaller. A hierarchical model across patient groups can provide additional power and a further reduction in mean sample size. Under the null, the addition of the hierarchical model decreases the mean sample size an additional 4\textendash 7 patients in each group. Under the alternative hypothesis, power is increased to at least 98\% in all groups. Limitations Hierarchical borrowing can make finding a single group in which the treatment is promising, if there is only one, more difficult. In a scenario where the treatment is uninteresting in all but one group, power for that one group is reduced to 65\%. When the drug appears promising in some groups and not in others, there is potential for borrowing to inflate the Type I error rate. Conclusions The Bayesian hierarchical design is more likely to correctly conclude efficacy or futility than the other two designs in many scenarios. The Bayesian hierarchical design is a strong design for addressing possibly differential effects in different groups. Clinical Trials 2013; 10: 720\textendash 734. http://ctj.sagepub.com},

The unusual sensitivity of seismicity to small stress changes in the Himalaya might be due to high pore pressure at seismogenic depth.},

Earth's tenfold increase in population has occurred during a time that is short compared to the return time of damaging earthquakes. In the next century, therefore, earthquakes that had little impact on villages and towns, will be shaking urban agglomerations housing upwards of 12 million people. An epicentral hit on a megacity has the potential to cause 1 million fatalities. The incorporation of earthquake resistant structures in the current global building boom, despite successes in the developed nations, has been neglected in the developing nations where historically earthquake damage has been high. The reasons for this neglect are attributed to indifference, ignorance and corrupt practices, not due to an absence of engineering competence. Never has a generation of earthquake engineers been faced with such a grave responsibility to exercise their skills, both political and technical, as now.},

Our goal is to achieve a robust and scalable methodology for two and three dimensional incompressible laminar flows. The Navier-Stokes operator discretization is done using boundary integrals and structured-grid finite elements. We use a two-step second-order accurate scheme to advance the equations in time. The convective term is discretized by an explicit, but unconditionally stable, semi-Lagrangian formulation; at each time step we inverta spatial constant-coefficient (modified) Stokes operator. The Dirichlet problem for the modified Stokes operator is formulated as a double-layer boundary integral equation. Domain integrals are computed via finite elements with appropriate forcing singularities to account for the irregular geometry. We use a velocity-pressure formulation which we discretize with bilinear elements (Q1-Q1), which give equal order interpolation for the velocities and pressures. Stabilization is used to circumvent the div-stability condition for the pressure space. The integral equations are discretized by Nystro\textasciidieresis m's method. For the specific approximation choices the method is second order accurate. We will present numerical results and discuss the performance and scalability of the method in two dimensions.},

The main features of our method are: (1) it can be applied to arbitrary geometries in a black-box fashion; (2) it is second order accurate; and (3) it has optimal algorithmic complexity.

We embed the domain in a rectangular domain, for which fast solvers are available, and we impose the boundary conditions as interface (jump) conditions on the velocities and tractions. We use an indirect boundary integral formulation for the homogeneous Stokes equations to compute the jumps. The resulting equations are discretized by Nystro\textasciidieresis m's method.

The proposed algorithm also immediately yields an O(1) algorithm for computing an arbitrary Gauss\textendash Legendre quadrature node. Such a capability is crucial for efficiently performing certain parallel computations with high order Legendre polynomials, such as computing an integral in parallel by means of Gauss\textendash Legendre quadrature and the parallel evaluation of Legendre series. In order to achieve the O(1) complexity, novel efficient asymptotic expansions are derived and used alongside known results.

Knowing the age of the SSZ also allows the suture to be used as a piercing line for calculating total offset along the Karakoram Fault, which effectively represents the SE border of the Tibetan Plateau and has played a major role in plateau evolution. We present a combined structural, geochemical, and geochronologic study of the SSZ as it is exposed in the Nubra region of India to test two competing hypotheses: that the SSZ is of Late Cretaceous or, alternatively, of Eocene age. Coarse-continental strata of the Saltoro Molasse, mapped in this area, contain detrital zircon populations suggestive of derivation from Eurasia despite the fact that the molasse itself is deposited unconformably onto Kohistan-Ladakh rocks, indicating that the molasse is postcollisional. The youngest population of detrital zircons in these rocks (approximately 92 Ma) and a U/Pb zircon date for a dike that cuts basal molasse outcrops (approximately 85 Ma) imply that deposition of the succession began in the Late Cretaceous. This establishes a minimum age for the SSZ and rules out the possibility of an Eocene collision between Kohistan-Ladakh and Eurasia. Our results support correlation of the SSZ with the Bangong suture zone in Tibet, which implies a total offset across the Karakoram Fault of approximately 130\textendash 190 km.},

Automated mesh generation from these voxel based image data can be achieved by direct conversion to hexahedron elements, however these model representations have jagged edges. This paper proposes an automated method to generate smoothed FE meshes from voxel-based image data. Mesh fairing processes are utilized that allow constraints that control the smoothing process, and are computationally efficient. Surfaces of the mesh on the exterior, as well as interfaces between two tissues, can be smoothed by varying fairing parameters and constraint criteria. The method was tested on a variety of real and simulated three-dimensional data sets, resulting in both hexahedron and tetrahedron meshes. It was shown that the fairing process is linearly related to the number of smoothing iterations, and that peak stresses are reduced in FE simulations of the smoothed models. Although developed for micro-CT data sets, this fast and reliable mesh smoothing method could be applied to any three-dimensional image data where node and element connectivity have been defined. r 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Surfaces are specified via a collection of smooth parameterizations given on triangles, a setting which generalizes the typical one of triangulated surfaces, and the integral equations are discretized via a high-order Nystro\textasciidieresis m method. This allows for rapid convergence in cases in which high-order surface information is available. The high-order discretization technique is coupled with a direct solver based on the recursive construction of scattering matrices. The result is a solver which often attains O(N 1.5) complexity in the number of discretization nodes N and which is resistant to many of the pathologies which stymie iterative solvers in the numerical simulation of scattering. The performance of the algorithm is illustrated with numerical experiments which involve the simulation of scattering from a variety of domains, including one consisting of a collection of 1000 ellipsoids with randomly oriented semiaxes arranged in a grid, and a domain whose boundary has 12 curved edges and 8 corner points.},

While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions \textendash{} something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art finetuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.},

This work combines physics-based models of slow-slip events with both mean ETS displacements and decadal-averaged deformation rates to explain the gap and determine how interseismic stress accumulates on the megathrust. While physics-based predictions match the average ETS displacements, they significantly misfit long-term rates, implying faster slip rates within both the gap and the ETS region. Heterogeneous Green's functions or velocity-strengthening friction within the gap cannot explain the decadal rates. The observed uplift rates require steeper gradients in slip rate at the base of the locked zone. We invert for the smallest possible shear stress rate on the creeping megathrust below a locked zone that satisfactorily fits the data. A nonzero shear stress rate within the ETS zone, reaching -2.5 kPa/yr at a depth of 25\textendash 30 km, is required. Finally, of all the models that adequately fit both horizontal and vertical data, only those with deep locking depths, around 21 km, significantly improve the fit to the uplift rates.},

  abstract = {Fold-and-thrust belts and accretionary wedges form by compression of sedimentary sequences and basement rocks into forward and backward thrusts, folds, nappes, and duplexes. For over a century, models have been used to investigate the essential characteristics of such brittle wedges. Here I review model studies of brittle thrust wedges in orthogonal compression, focussing on critical taper theory, analogue and numerical techniques for modelling brittle behaviour, and the most commonly investigated variations in wedge model studies, those in basal dip, basal strength, internal strength, and surface processes. Many model results can be placed in the context of critical taper theory, which provides analytical solutions for wedge taper angle and slip line orientations for a homogeneous material on the verge of failure throughout. Dynamic forward models have confirmed critical taper predictions of decreasing surface dip for increasing basal dip, wider wedges with steeper forward thrusts and shallower backward thrusts for decreasing basal strength, narrower wedges and enhanced exhumation for surface erosion, and decreasing surface dip for increasing internal strength. But analogue and numerical models have been able to take these results a step further by investigating the evolution of non-critical thrust wedges and the effects of non-homogeneous materials with d\'ecollement layers and strain-weakening shear zones. These results have highlighted the strong impact of heterogeneous materials on the internal structures of thrust wedges and raise the question whether the complexity of structures that are observed in many natural fold-and-thrust belts requires that lithological layering, inherited faults, or a wide range of rheologies need to be included in forward models of brittle thrust wedges.},

Geodetic inferences of the viscous strength of the upper mantle are consistent with flow of mantle rocks at temperatures and water contents determined from surface heat-flow, seismic, and mantle xenolith studies. Laboratory results show that deformation mechanisms and rheology strongly vary as a function of stress, grain size, and fluids. Field studies reveal a strong tendency for deformation in the lower crust and uppermost mantle in and adjacent to fault zones to localize into systems of discrete shear zones with strongly reduced grain size and strength. Deformation mechanisms and rheology may vary over short spatial (shear zone) and temporal (earthquake cycle) scales.},

Most recently, with colleagues, I have been able to show that deep-seated plumes of the past {$\sim$}5.5 \texttimes{} 108 years have risen only from narrow plume generation zones (PGZs) at the coremantle boundary (CMB) mostly on the edges of two Large Low Shear wave Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs) that have been stable, antipodal, and equatorial in their present positions for hundreds of millions of years and perhaps much longer. A need now is to develop an understanding of Earth that embodies plate tectonics, deeply subducted slabs, and stable LLSVPs with plumes that rise from PGZs on the CMB.},

  abstract = {There has been much debate recently concerning the long-term (i.e., {$>$}1 m.y.) strength of continental lithosphere. In one model, dubbed jelly sandwich, the strength resides in the crust and mantle, while in another, dubbed cr\`eme br\^ul\'ee, the mantle is weak and the strength is limited to the crust. The different models have arisen because of conflicting results from elastic thickness and earthquake data. We address the problem here by first reviewing elastic thickness estimates and their relationship to the seismogenic layer thickness. We then explore, by numerical thermomechanical modeling, the implications of a weak and strong mantle for structural styles. We argue that, irrespective of the actual crustal strength, the cr\`eme-br\^ul\'ee model is unable to explain either the persistence of mountain ranges or the integrity of the downgoing slab in collisional systems. We conclude that while the cr\`eme-br\^ul\'ee model may apply in some tectonic settings, a more widely applicable model is the jelly sandwich.},

By distributing the union of octants from all octrees in parallel, we combine the high scalability proven previously for adaptive single-octree algorithms with the geometric flexibility that can be achieved by arbitrarily connected hexahedral macromeshes, in which each macroelement is the root of an adapted octree. A key concept of our approach is an encoding scheme of the interoctree connectivity that permits arbitrary relative orientations between octrees. Based on this encoding we develop interoctree transformations of octants. These form the basis for high-level parallel octree algorithms, which are designed to interact with an application code such as a numerical solver for partial differential equations. We have implemented and tested these algorithms in the p4est software library. We demonstrate the parallel scalability of p4est on its own and in combination with two geophysics codes. Using p4est we generate and adapt multioctree meshes with up to 5.13 \texttimes{} 1011 octants on as many as 220,320 CPU cores and execute the 2:1 balance algorithm in less than 10 seconds per million octants per process.},

These results are consistent with recent geodetic studies in Asia, and indicate that crustal motions in Mongolia and north China derived from geodetic measurements are significantly faster than those proposed by most deformation models of Asia. Using a numerical model, we test whether post-seismic deformation caused by viscoelastic relaxation in the lower crust following the Tsetserleg\textendash Bolnay earthquake sequence (Mw = 7.9 and 8.4, 1905 July) can explain this discrepancy. We find that surface velocities at the GPS sites presented here for the 1997\textendash 2000 time period can reach 4 mm yr-1, depending on the earthquake source parameters and the rheology used in the models. Using a model based on our best current knowledge of lithospheric structure and rheology in the Mongolia\textendash Baikal area, we find that the contribution of post-seismic effects to the GPS velocities presented here is less than 2 mm yr-1 for the Mongolian sites and less than 1 mm yr-1 for the Baikal sites. We therefore conclude that the post-seismic effects of the Mw = 8.4, 1905 Bolnay earthquake cannot explain why the GPS-derived crustal motions in Mongolia and the Baikal rift zone are significantly larger than those proposed by deformation models of Asia. This discrepancy must therefore be sought in processes not accounted for in most of these deformation models, such as the farfield contribution of the Pacific subduction zones and/or the effect of gravitational forces on intracontinental deformation.},

  abstract = {In a lithosphere where dislocation creep dominates the steady-state flow and the viscosity is stress-dependent, the equilibrium between tectonic stress and strain rate is broken after an earthquake due to the sudden coseismic stress change. The imbalance between tectonic stress and strain rate manifests itself during the post-seismic phase and, when seismic stress is comparable or smaller than tectonic stress, it affects post-seismic deformation via an effective anisotropy along the principal axes of the tectonic stress tensor. This issue is herein discussed within the framework of post-seismic models based on power-law Maxwell rheologies and, in the limit case of seismic stress much smaller than tectonic stress, we obtain a first-order approximation of the rheology which results into a linear anisotropic Maxwell model and we find that the effective anisotropy is associated to a two-modal relaxation characterized by the Maxwell time and the Maxwell time divided by the power-law index. Thus, as far as the steady-state flow within the lithosphere is dominated by dislocation creep, linear isotropic viscoelastic rheologies, like Newtonian Maxwell and Burgers models, represent a severe oversimplification which does not account for the physics of post-seismic deformation. This new physics is discussed characterizing the stress state of the ductile layers of the lithosphere before and after the earthquake for normal, inverse and strike mechanisms and for a variety of continental seismogenic zones and thermal models. We show that the first-order approximation of the power-law Maxwell rheology is valid for a quite wide range of small and moderate earthquakes. The most restrictive upper bounds of the seismic magnitude (which hold for the hottest thermal model here considered, with lithospheric thickness of H = 80 km and surface heat flux of Q = 70 mW m-2) occur for normal and inverse earthquakes and are 5.6 or 6.3 for a lower crust of wet diorite or felsic granulite, and 6.5 for a mantle of wet olivine. The upper bounds increase by about 0.3\textendash 0.4 for strike earthquakes and by more than 1.0 for the cold thermal model (H = 200 km and Q = 50 mW m-2).},

However, when more equivalent points are used to achieve higher accuracy, the efficiency of the FFT approach tends to be lower because more auxiliary volume grid points have to be added. In this paper, all the translations of the KIFMM are accelerated by using the singular value decomposition (SVD) based on the lowrank property of the translating matrices. The acceleration of M2L is realized by first transforming the associated translating matrices into more compact form, and then using low-rank approximations. By using the transform matrices for M2L, the orders of the translating matrices in upward and downward passes are also reduced. The improved KIFMM is then applied to accelerate BEM. The performance of the proposed algorithms are demonstrated by three examples. Numerical results show that, compared with the original KIFMM, the present method can reduce about 40\% of the iterating time and 25\% of the memory requirement.},

The complexity of transforming a set of function samples to their corresponding spherical harmonic coefficients is largely dominated by the computation of the associated Legendre transform. This associated Legendre transform requires the computation of (L + 1) dense matrix-vector products where L is the order of the spherical harmonic expansion. Since the number of rows and columns of each of these matrices depends on L, this step is essentially O(L3). In this paper, we explore the GPU parallelism available to improve the butterfly compression approach. We present some preliminary results showing performance increases for large problem sizes and eventually plan to release the MonarchSHT library for GPU spherical harmonic transforms.},

Our results include measurements of the frictional properties of cuttings and core samples recovered at depths of \textasciitilde 2.7 km. We find that materials from the two actively creeping faults exhibit low frictional strengths ({$\mu$} = \textasciitilde 0.1), velocity-strengthening friction behavior, and near-zero or negative rates of frictional healing. Our experimental data set shows that the center of the CDZ is the weakest section of the San Andreas Fault, with {$\mu$} = \textasciitilde 0.10. Fault weakness is highly localized and likely caused by abundant magnesium-rich clays. In contrast, serpentine from within the SDZ, and wall rock of both the SDZ and CDZ, exhibits velocity-weakening friction behavior and positive healing rates, consistent with nearby repeating microearthquakes. Finally, we document higher friction coefficients ({$\mu$} {$>$} 0.4) and complex rate-dependent behavior for samples recovered across the NBF. In total, our data provide an integrated view of fault behavior for the three active fault strands encountered at SAFOD and offer a consistent explanation for observations of creep and microearthquakes along weak fault zones within a strong crust.},

  abstract = {The Fast Multipole Method was introduced by Greengard and Rokhlin in a seminal paper appeared in 1987 for studying large systems of particle interactions with reduced algorithmic and memory complexity [60]. Developments of the original idea are successfully applied to the analysis of many scientific and engineering problems of practical interest. In scattering analysis, multipole techniques may enable to reduce the computational complexity of iterative solution procedures involving dense matrices arising from the discretization of integral operators from O(n2) to O(n log n) arithmetic operations. In this paper we discuss recent algorithmic developments of algebraic preconditioning techniques for the Fast Multipole Method for 2D and 3D scattering problems. We focus on design aspects, implementation details, numerical scalability, parallel performance on emerging computer systems, and give some minor emphasis to theoretical aspects as well. Thanks to the use of iterative techniques and efficient parallel preconditioners, fast integral solvers involving tens of million unknowns are nowadays feasible and can be integrated in the design processes.},

  abstract = {The boundary element method has become a popular tool for the solution of Maxwell's equations in electromagnetism. From a linear algebra point of view, this leads to the solution of large dense complex linear systems, where the unknowns are associated with the edges of the mesh defined on the surface of the illuminated object. In this paper, we address the iterative solution of these linear systems via preconditioned Krylov solvers. Our primary focus is on the design of an efficient parallelizable preconditioner. In that respect, we consider an approximate inverse method based on the Frobenius-norm minimization. The preconditioner is constructed from a sparse approximation of the dense coefficient matrix, and the patterns both for the preconditioner and for the coefficient matrix are computed a priori using geometric information from the mesh. We describe how such a preconditioner can be naturally implemented in a parallel code that implements the multipole technique for the matrix-vector product calculation. We investigate the numerical scalability of our preconditioner on realistic industrial test problems and show that it exhibits some limitations on very large problems of size close to one million unknowns. To improve its robustness on those large problems we propose an embedded iterative scheme that combines nested GMRES solvers with different fast multipole computations. We show through extensive numerical experiments that this new scheme is extremely robust at affordable memory and CPU costs for the solution of very large and challenging problems.},

  abstract = {The Northern Cap de Creus shear belt provides \textregistered ne examples of shear zones developed at different scales in rocks bearing pre-existing penetrative foliations. The shear zones developed under retrograde metamorphic conditions, and they are preferentially located in crystalline schists. Lower grade metasedimentary rocks accommodated deformation by folding. The shear zones are linked in an anastomosing framework with self-similar properties. They are interpreted to have formed as the result of a progressive wrench-dominated deformation affecting anisotropic rocks. A progressive non-coaxial deformation regime is considered responsible for the development of the complex kinematic pattern, wherein shear zones with opposite senses of shear may come to lie in close parallelism. In such a framework, individual shear zones are characterised by marked strain gradients not only across the shear zone, but also along it. These features, together with the geometrical analysis of shear zone marginal domains, indicate that these structures developed with a component of shortening across the shear zones. The shear zones are interpreted to have nucleated as buckling instabilities that gradually evolved to become shear zones approaching the simple shear model. Microstructural and quartz c-axis fabric analyses indicate that shear zone formation is associated with strong strain partitioning on all scales. q 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Crucial implementation issues, including the truncation of the multipole expansion, the optimal number of levels, the direct and inverse extrapolation steps are examined in detail with the backing of numerical experiments. A complexity analysis for both the single-level and multi-level versions is conducted. The correctness and computational performances of the proposed elastodynamic FMM are demonstrated on numerical examples, featuring up to O(106) DOFs run on a single-processor PC and including the diffraction of an incident P plane wave by a semi-spherical or semi-ellipsoidal canyon, representative of topographic site effects.},

It is well known in the literature that standard H-matrix based methods, although very efficient tools for asymptotically smooth kernels, are not optimal for oscillatory kernels. H2-matrix and directional approaches have been proposed to overcome this problem. However the implementation of such methods is much more involved than the standard H-matrix representation. The central questions we address are twofold. (i) What is the frequency-range in which the H-matrix format is an efficient representation for 3D elastodynamic problems? (ii) What can be expected of such an approach to model problems in mechanical engineering? We show that even though the method is not optimal (in the sense that more involved representations can lead to faster algorithms) an efficient solver can be easily developed. The capabilities of the method are illustrated on numerical examples using the Boundary Element Method.},

The fast multiple method (FMM) has asymptotically linear time complexity with a guaranteed approximation accuracy, making it an attractive candidate for a wide variety of particle system simulations on future exascale systems. This paper reports on three key advances. First, we present lower bounds on cache complexity for key phases of the FMM and use these bounds to derive analytical performance models. Secondly, using these models, we present results for choosing the optimal algorithmic tuning parameter. Lastly, we use these performance models to make predictions about FMM's scalability on possible exascale system configurations, based on current technology trends. Looking forward to exascale, we suggest that the FMM, though highly compute-bound on today's systems, could in fact become memory bound by 2020.},

The model includes a strong upper crust, a weak ductile lower crust, and a strong mantle part. The lithosphere is underlain by a low-viscosity asthenosphere. Subduction is produced by a piston (push force) and the pull force from the mantle lithospheric layer which is slightly denser than the asthenosphere. The results of the modelling are tested on the example of the Himalayas. In the experiments all lithospheric layers subduct into the mantle to a depth corresponding to 200-300 km in nature until the upper crustal layer fails in front of the subduction zone, forming a first major thrust fault (the MCT in our interpretation of the Himalayas). Underthrusting along this fault increases relief, which upon reaching a height corresponding to several kilometres in nature, is removed mechanically by a blade (the blade is moved horizontally back and forth throughout the experiment). This `erosional' unloading mechanism causes the previously subducted segment of the buoyant upper crust to slide upward over the weak lower crust at a rate comparable to the subduction rate. The rise of the crustal slice accelerates displacement along the crustal thrust, while producing a normal sense motion and exhumation of the material from great depth (up to 40-50 km depending on the model parameters) along the upper surface of the slice. The rapid uplift of the crust then ceases, and the orogenesis occurs further due to continuing underthrusting along the first major thrust. At a certain stage the crust fails again, producing a new major crustal thrust (the MJ3T in the Himalayas).},

Similarly, applying DEMON to momentum SGD improves over momentum SGD with learning rate decay in most cases. Notably, DEMON momentum SGD is observed to be significantly less sensitive to parameter tuning than momentum SGD with learning rate decay schedule, critical to training neural networks in practice. Results are demonstrated across a variety of settings and architectures, including image classification, generative models, and language models.

  abstract = {The Punchbowl fault is an exhumed, 40C km displacement fault of the San Andreas system. In the Devil's Punchbowl, the fault contains a continuous ultracataclasite layer along which the Punchbowl Formation sandstone and an igneous and metamorphic basement complex are juxtaposed. The fabric of the ultracataclasite layer and surrounding rock indicate that nearly all of the fault displacement occurred in the layer. By analogy with nearby active faults, we assume that the Punchbowl fault was seismogenic and that the ultracataclasite structure records the passage of numerous earthquake ruptures. We have mapped the ultracataclasite layer at 1 : 1 and 1 : 10 to determine the mode of failure and to constrain the processes of seismic slip. On the basis of color, cohesion, fracture and vein fabric, and porphyroclast lithology, two main types of ultracataclasite are distinguished in the layer: an olive-black ultracataclasite in contact with the basement, and a dark yellowish brown ultracataclasite in contact with the sandstone. The two are juxtaposed along a continuous contact that is often coincident with a single, continuous, nearly planar, prominent fracture surface (pfs) that extends the length of the ultracataclasite layer in all exposures. No significant mixing of the brown and black ultracataclasites occurred by offset on anastomosing shear surfaces that cut the contact or by mobilization and injection of one ultracataclasite into the other. The ultracataclasites are cohesive throughout except for thin accumulations of less cohesive, reworked ultracataclasite along the pfs. Structural relations suggest that: (1) the black and brown ultracataclasite were derived from the basement and sandstone, respectively; (2) the black and brown ultracataclasites were juxtaposed along the pfs; (3) the subsequent, final several kilometers of slip on the Punchbowl fault occurred along the pfs; and (4) earthquake ruptures followed the pfs without significant branching or jumping to other locations in the ultracataclasite. By comparison with rock friction experiments, the slip localization along the pfs in the ultracataclasite implies rate weakening behavior with a critical slip distance similar to laboratory values, and thus relatively small nucleation and breakdown dimensions for earthquake ruptures. Of the various mechanisms proposed to explain the low strength of the San Andreas and to produce dynamic weakening of faults, those that require or assume extreme localization of slip are most compatible with our observations.},

These assumptions enable us to explain the complexity of the fully decoupled neural network through the prism of the results from random matrix theory. We show that for large-size decoupled networks the lowest critical values of the random loss function form a layered structure and they are located in a well-defined band lower-bounded by the global minimum. The number of local minima outside that band diminishes exponentially with the size of the network. We empirically verify that the mathematical model exhibits similar behavior as the computer simulations, despite the presence of high dependencies in real networks. We conjecture that both simulated annealing and SGD converge to the band of low critical points, and that all critical points found there are local minima of high quality measured by the test error. This emphasizes a major difference between large- and small-size networks where for the latter poor quality local minima have non-zero probability of being recovered. Finally, we prove that recovering the global minimum becomes harder as the network size increases and that it is in practice irrelevant as global minimum often leads to overfitting.},

After the India \textendash{} Asia collision, which started in the early Tertiary and terminated the Gangdese arc magmatism in the Lhasa terrane made of the southern Tibetan plateau, widespread potassium-rich lavas and subordinate sodium-rich basalts were generated from f 50 to 30 Ma in the Qiangtang terrane of northern Tibet. Subsequent post-collisional magmatism migrated southwards, producing ultrapotassic and adakitic lavas coevally between f 26 and 10 Ma in the Lhasa terrane. Then potassic volcanism was renewed to the north and has become extensive and semicontinuous since f 13 Ma in the western Qiangtang and Songpan \textendash{} Ganze terranes. Such spatial \textendash{} temporal variations enable us to elaborate a geodynamic evolution model which depicts when and how the Indian continental lithospheric mantle started thrusting under Asia by involving rollback and breakoff of the subducted Neo-Tethyan slab followed by removal of the thickened Lhasa lithospheric root. We propose that only after the lithospheric removal, which occurred at f 26 Ma, could the Indian mantle lithosphere have commenced its northward underthrusting and henceforth served as a pivotal control to the Himalayan \textendash{} Tibetan orogenesis. Consequently, the Tibetan plateau is suggested to have risen diachronously from south to north. Whereas the southern part of the plateau may have been created and maintained since the late Oligocene, the northern plateau would have not attained its present-day elevation and size until the mid-Miocene when the lower part of the western Qiangtang and Songpan \textendash Ganze lithospheres began to founder owing to the push of the underthrust Indian mantle lithosphere.},

Thermochronology from deep river gorges that are cut into the relict landscape shows slow cooling between ca. 100 and ca. 10\textendash 20 Ma and a change to rapid cooling after ca. 13 Ma with initiation of rapid river incision at 0.25\textendash 0.5 mm/yr between 9 and 13 Ma.

  abstract = {Topography extracted from swath profiles along the northern, southern, and eastern margins of the Tibetan Plateau show two end-member morphologies: steep, abrupt margins and longwavelength, low-gradient margins. Because the lack of significant upper crustal shortening across much of the eastern plateau margin implies that the crustal thickening occurs mainly in the deep crust, we compare regional topographic gradients surrounding the plateau to model results for flux of a Newtonian fluid through a lower crustal channel of uniform thickness. For an assumed 15-km-thick channel, we estimate a viscosity for the lower crust of 1018 Pa{$\cdot$}s beneath the low-gradient margins, 1021 Pa{$\cdot$}s beneath the steep margins, and an upper bound of 1016 Pa{$\cdot$}s beneath the plateau. These results indicate that the large-scale morphology of the eastern plateau reflects fluid flow within the underlying crust; crustal material flows around the strong crust of the Sichuan and Tarim Basins, creating broad, gentle margins, and ``piles up'' behind the basins creating narrow, steep margins. These results imply that this portion of the Eurasian crust was heterogeneous, but largely weak, even prior to construction of the Tibetan Plateau.},

Several physicists using Burridge and Knopoff's box and spring model of faulting have proposed that fault complexity may arise from the spontaneous development of a self-similar stress distribution on the fault plane. If this model proves to be correct, it has important consequences for the origin of the complexity of seismic sources. In order to test these ideas on a more realistic earthquake model, we developed a new boundary integral equation method for studying rupture propagation along an antiplane fault in the presence of nonlinear rate-dependent friction. We study rupture dynamics of models with single and twin asperities. In our models, asperities are places on the fault with a higher value of prestress. Otherwise all fault parameters are homogeneous. We show that for models with such asperities, a slip velocity weakening friction leads to the propagation of supersonic healing phases and to the spontaneous arrest of fracture if the prestress outside the asperities is low enough. For models with asperities, we can also observe narrow slip velocity pulses, qualitatively similar to the so-called Heaton pulses observed in some earthquake aceelerograms. We also observe a complex distribution of stress after the rupture that depends on details of the initial distribution of asperities and on the details of the friction law.},

  abstract = {The extended finite element method (XFEM) provides a natural way to incorporate strong and weak discontinuities into discretizations. It alleviates the need to mesh discontinuities, allowing simulation meshes to be nearly independent of discontinuity geometry. Currently, both quasistatic deformation and dynamic earthquake rupture simulations under standard FEM are limited to simplified fault networks, as generating meshes that both conform with the faults and have appropriate properties for accurate simulation is a difficult problem. In addition, fault geometry is not well known; robustness of solution to fault geometry must be determined. Remeshing with varying geometry would make such tests computationally unfeasible. The XFEM makes a natural choice for discretization in these crustal deformation simulations on complex fault systems. Here, we develop a method based upon the XFEM using Nitsche's method to apply boundary conditions, enabling the solution of static deformation and dynamic earthquake models. We compare several approaches to calculating and applying frictional tractions. Finally, we demonstrate the method with two problems: an earthquake community dynamic code verification benchmark and a quasistatic problem on a fault system model of southern California.},

Offset alluvial fan surfaces indicate one or more magnitude 7.6\textendash 8.4 thrust-faulting earthquakes on the Tapti Fault (Maharashtra, western India) during the Holocene. The high ratio of fault displacement to length on the alluvial fan offsets implies high stress-drop faulting, as has been observed elsewhere in the peninsula. The along-strike extent of the fan offsets is similar to the thickness of the seismogenic layer, suggesting a roughly equidimensional fault rupture. The subsiding footwall of the fault is likely to have been responsible for altering the continental-scale drainage pattern in central India and creating the large west flowing catchment of the Tapti river. A preexisting sedimentary basin in the uplifting hanging wall implies that the Tapti Fault was active as a normal fault during the Mesozoic and has been reactivated as a thrust, highlighting the role of preexisting structures in determining the rheology and deformation of the lithosphere. The slip sense of faults and earthquakes in India suggests that deformation south of the Ganges foreland basin is driven by the compressive force transmitted between India and the Tibetan Plateau. The along-strike continuation of faulting to the east of the Holocene ruptures we have studied represents a significant seismic hazard in central India.},

Physical experiments are described that model shortening of a thick brittle cover overlying a weak, viscous de\^Acollement to gain a better understanding of these differences. We tested the in\textasciimacron uence of (1) the de\^Acollement layer thickness and (2) the presence of a deformable backstop on the hinterland side and of a de\^Acollement pinch-out on the foreland side. Because of the very low shear strength of the viscous de\^Acollement, folds and thrusts did not propagate according to a piggyback sequence but by centripetal, back-and-forth propagation. Additional shortening was accommodated by growth of all existing structures. Fold symmetry and thrust vergence varied between experiments. Models con\textregistered ned between two rigid, vertical endwalls always deformed by symmetric folding and thrusting. In models having a deformable backstop and a foreland de\^Acollement pinch-out, forethrusting initially dominated, folds were asymmetric, and fault blocks rotated. In models having a thick de\^Acollement layer, folds kept growing asymmetrically. Diapirism also depended on the initial de\^Acollement geometry. Diapirs formed only in models having a deformable backstop and were restricted to the hanging wall of a fault-related fold. Finally, the implications of such kinematics on the thermal history are discussed as well as the likelihood of hydrocarbon maturation and preservation. q 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The effectiveness of the methodology is demonstrated through numerical examples, indicating that a significant reduction of memory and CPU time can be achieved with respect to the classical boundary element method. This allows increasing the problem size by one order of magnitude. The proposed methodology therefore offers perspectives to study large scale problems involving three\textendash dimensional elastodynamic wave propagation in a layered halfspace, with possible applications in seismology and dynamic soil\textendash structure interaction.},

  abstract = {Although some preconditioners are available for solving dense linear systems, there are still many matrices for which preconditioners are lacking, in particular in cases where the size of the matrix N becomes very large. Examples of preconditioners include ILU preconditioners that sparsify the matrix based on some threshold, algebraic multigrid, and specialized preconditioners, e.g., Calder\textasciiacute on and other analytical approximation methods when available. Despite these methods, there remains a great need to develop general purpose preconditioners whose cost scales well with the matrix size N . In this paper, we propose a preconditioner, with broad applicability and with cost O(N ), for dense matrices, when the matrix is given by a smooth kernel. Extending the method using the same framework to general H2-matrices (i.e., algebraic instead of defined in terms of an analytical kernel) is relatively straightforward, but this won't be discussed here. These preconditioners have a controlled accuracy (e.g., machine accuracy can be achieved if needed) and scale linearly with N . They are based on an approximate direct solve of the system. The linear scaling of the algorithm is achieved by means of two key ideas. First, the H2-structure of the dense matrix is exploited to obtain an extended sparse system of equations. Second, fill-ins arising when performing the elimination of the latter are compressed as low-rank matrices if they correspond to well-separated interactions. This ensures that the sparsity pattern of the extended sparse matrix is preserved throughout the elimination, hence resulting in a very efficient algorithm with O(N log(1/{$\epsilon$})2) computational cost and O(N log 1/{$\epsilon$}) memory requirement, for an error tolerance 0 {$<$} {$\epsilon$} {$<$} 1. The solver is inexact, although the error can be controlled and made as small as needed. These solvers are related to ILU in the sense that the fill-in is controlled. However, in ILU, most of the fill-in (i.e., below a certain tolerance) is simply discarded, whereas here it is approximated using low-rank blocks, with a prescribed tolerance. Numerical examples are discussed to demonstrate the linear scaling of the method and to illustrate its effectiveness as a preconditioner.},

Here we show that the central Altyn Tagh fault slipped at only 14\textendash 9 mm/a over the past 4\textendash 6 ka by tightly bracketing the age of a displaced fluvial terrace riser at Yuemake (88.51\textdegree E, 38.19\textdegree N).

Here the separate streams of the literature of this progress are reviewed comparatively to highlight commonality and contrasts in the mechanics and physics. Much of the value of the new work resides in the new questions it has raised, which suggests profitable areas for research in the next few years and beyond. From the viewpoint of fundamental science, excitement is greatest in the struggle to probe the character of dynamic fracture at the atomic scale, using Newtonian or quantum mechanics as appropriate (a qualifier to be debated!). But lively interest is also directed towards modeling and experimentation at macroscales, including the geological, where the science of fracture is pulled at once by fundamental issues, such as the curious effects of friction, and the structural, where dynamic effects are essential to proper design or certification and even in manufacture. r 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The mechanical behavior\textemdash and hence earthquake potential\textemdash of faults in continental interiors is an issue of critical importance for the resultant seismic hazard, but no consensus has yet been reached on this controversial topic. The debate has focused on the central and eastern United States, in particular, the New Madrid Seismic Zone, struck by four magnitude 7 or greater earthquakes in 1811\textendash 1812, and to a lesser extent the Wabash Valley Seismic Zone just to the north. A key aspect of this issue is the rate at which strain is currently accruing on those plate interior faults, a quantity that remains debated. Here we address this issue with an analysis of up to 14.6 years of continuous GPS data from a network of 200 sites in the central United States centered on the New Madrid and Wabash Valley seismic zones. We find that the high-quality sites in these regions show motions that are consistently within the 95\% confidence limit of zero deformation. These results place an upper bound on strain accrual on faults of 0.2 mm/yr and 0.6 mm/yr in the New Madrid and Wabash Valley Seismic Zones, respectively. For the New Madrid region, where a paleoseismic record is available for the past {$\sim$}5000 years, we argue that strain accrual\textemdash if any\textemdash does not permit the 500\textendash 900 year repeat time of paleo-earthquakes observed in the Upper Mississippi Embayment. These results, together with increasing evidence for temporal clustering and spatial migration of earthquake sequences in continental interiors, indicate that either tectonic loading rates or fault properties vary with time in the New Madrid Seismic Zone and possibly plate wide.},

  abstract = {A review of field observations reveals that faults in the upper crust initiate in one of three styles: linkage of pre-existing structures, linkage of precursory structures, or by localization of slip in a precursory shear zone. The first two styles can be characterized by three general stages. During stage 1, faults initiate by shear along pre-existing structures (formed during an earlier event), or by the initiation of precursor structures (formed earlier in the same deformation event). Stage 2 involves the pre-existing or precursor structures becoming linked by differently orientated structures, as stresses are perturbed within the developing fault zone. Linkage allows displacement to increase. A through-going fault develops during stage 3. The third style of fault initiation requires the development of a shear zone, which may change local mechanical properties and lead to faulting. These observations highlight the importance of mode I fracturing in the initial stages of faulting. Rock architecture and the orientation of layering with respect to the principal stresses exert a strong influence over the style of fault initiation. Most brittle faults in the upper crust initiate from precursory structures, and the mechanism for fault growth changes with scale. Thus we should not expect a simple, universal slip \textendash length scaling relationship for faults.},

This procedure-the displacement discontinuity method-consists simply of placing N displacement discontinuities of unknown magnitude along the boundaries of the region to be analyzed, then setting up and solving a system of algebraic equations to find the discontinuity values that produce prescribed boundary tractions or displacements.The displacement discontinuity method is in some respects similar to integral equation or `influence function' techniques, and contrasts with finite difference and finite element procedures in that approximations are made only on the boundary contours, and not in the field. The method is illustrated by comparing computed results with the analytical solutions of two boundary value problems: a circular disc subjected to diametral compression, and a circular hole in an infinite plate under a uniaxial stress field. In both cases the numerical results are in excellent agreement with the exact solutions.},

The 206Pb/238U dates from 17 of 19 grains are equivalent with a weighted mean of 767.1 {$\pm$} 0.9 ka that overlaps with the published 40Ar/39Ar sanidine age, requiring that most zircon crystallized immediately before eruption. Dates from two grains that are 6 and 12 k.y. older indicate minimum times that a small portion of the grains resided in the magma. These findings are consistent with chemical zoning patterns in zircon that suggest a relatively simple crystallization history, yet contrast with previous results of ion microprobe dating of zircon that show 50\textendash 80 k.y. of magma residence. The weighted mean 207Pb/235U date is \textasciitilde 52 k.y. older than the 206Pb/238U date, a difference that is attributed to excess 207Pb from initial Pa/U disequilibrium.

This has brought dramatic increase in the capability of particle simulations in many application areas, such as electrostatics, particle formulations of fluid mechanics, and others. Although the literature on the subject provides theoretical error bounds for the FMM approximation, there are not many reports of the measured errors in a suite of computational experiments. We have performed such an experimental investigation, and summarized the results of about 1000 calculations using the FMM algorithm, to characterize the accuracy of the method in relation with the different parameters available to the user. In addition to the more standard diagnostic of the maximum error, we supply illustrations of the spatial distribution of the errors, which offers visual evidence of all the contributing factors to the overall approximation accuracy: multipole expansion, local expansion, hierarchical spatial decomposition (interaction lists, local domain, far domain). This presentation is a contribution to any researcher wishing to incorporate the FMM acceleration to their application code, as it aids in understanding where accuracy is gained or compromised.},

Late Cenozoic uplift and mountain building in the Mongolian Altai is dominated by regional-scale dextral strike\textendash slip faults that link with thrust and oblique\textendash slip faults within a 300-km-wide deforming belt sandwiched between the more rigid Junggar Basin block and Hangay Precambrian craton. Dominant orogenic elements in the Mongolian Altai include double restraining bends, terminal restraining bends, partial restraining bends, single thrust ridges, thrust ridges linked by strike\textendash slip faults, and triangular block uplifts in areas of conjugate strike\textendash slip faults. The overall pattern is similar to a regional strike\textendash slip duplex array; however, the significant amount of contractional and oblique\textendash slip displacement within the range and large number of historical oblique\textendash slip seismic events renders the term btranspressional duplexQ more accurate. Intramontane and range flanking basins can be classified as ramp basins, halframp basins, open-sided thrust basins, pull-apart basins, and strike\textendash slip basins. Neither a classic fold-and-thrust orogenic wedge geometry nor a bounding foredeep exists. The manner in which upper crustal transpressional deformation is balanced in the lower crust is unknown; however, crustal thickening by lower crustal inflation and northward outflow of lower crustal material are consistent with existing geological and geodetic data and could account for late Cenozoic regional epeirogenic uplift in the Russian Altai and Sayan regions.},

  abstract = {The Sutai Range is a structural and topographic culmination at the southeastern end of the Mongolian Altai and a world-class example of an actively forming restraining bend. The range occurs at a major stepover zone along the Tonhil dextral strike-slip fault within a wider region dominated by late Cenozoic transpressional deformation. Analysis of satellite imagery and the results of field investigations reveal that the range is structurally asymmetric with an overall NE tilt due to several major SE-directed thrusts within the core of the range and along its SW margin. The distribution of alluvial sediments shed from the range and stream length asymmetries also indicate a regional NE tilt for the range. Faults that splay off of the main Tonhil Fault bound discrete uplifted blocks that define an oblique-slip duplex at the surface and asymmetric flower structure in cross-section. Outward growth of the range is partly accommodated by growth of foreberg thrust ridges within the adjacent Dariv Basin. Thrust blocks within the centre of the range expose basement schists and mylonitic granite suggesting that the greatest uplift and crustal exhumation has occurred within the core of the restraining bend, although much of the exhumation is likely to be due to older Palaeozoic structural events. The southeast and northwest ends of the range are characterized by smooth unbroken surface ramps (``gangplanks'') that are upwarped towards the centre of the range where maximum Cenozoic uplift has occurred. The geometry and evolution of Sutai Uul and other intracontinental and intraplate restraining bends is fundamentally influenced by the initial width of the stepover zone, the attitude of regional basement structures and extent of brittle reactivation, the direction of SHmax relative to basement structures, and progressive fault and block rotation which may change the kinematics along faults or lead to their abandonment.},

Major thrusts in Karlik Tagh connect along strike to the east with the left-lateral Gobi\textendash Tien Shan Fault System in SW Mongolia. From a Mongolian perspective, Karlik Tagh represents a large restraining bend for this regional strike-slip fault system, and the entire system of thrusts and strike-slip faults in the Karlik Tagh region defines a horsetail splay fault geometry. Regionally, there appears to be a kinematic transition from thrust-dominated deformation in the central Tien Shan to left-lateral transpressional deformation in the easternmost Tien Shan. This transition correlates with a general eastward decrease in mountain belt width and average elevation and a change in the angular relationship between the NNE-directed maximum horizontal stress in the region and the pre-existing basement structural grain, which is northwesterly in the central Tien Shan (orthogonal to SHmax) but more east\textendash west in the eastern Tien Shan (acute angular relationship with SHmax). Ar\textendash Ar ages indicate that major range-bounding thrusts in Barkol and Karlik Tagh are latest Permian\textendash Triassic ductile thrust zones that underwent brittle reactivation in the Late Cenozoic.

Our purpose was to document the structuresresponsible for Cenozoic uplift of the range in order to better understand processes of intracontinental mountain building. Historical right-lateral strike-slip and oblique-slip earthquakeshave previously been documented from the Western Altai, and many mountain fronts are marked by active fault scarpsindicating current tectonic activity and uplift. The dominant structuresin the range are long ({$>$}200 km) NNW trending right-lateral strike-slip faults. Our transect can be divided into three separate domains that contain active, right-lateral strike-slip master faults and thrust faults with opposing vergence. The current deformationregime is thus transpressional.Each domain has an asymmetricflower structurecross-sectionagl eometry, and the transect as a whole is interpreted as three separatelarge flower structures. The mechanismof uplift along the transect appears to be horizontal and vertical growth of flower structures rooted into the dominant right-lateral strike-slip faults. The major Bulgan Fault forms the southernstructural boundary to the range and is a 3.5-km-wide brittle-ductile zone that has accommodated reverse and left-lateral strikeslip displacements.It appearsto be linked to the North Gobi Fault Zone to the east and Irtysh Fault zone to the west and thus may be over 900 km in length. Two major ductile leftlateral extensional shear zones were identified in the interior of the rangethat appearto be preservedstructuresrelatedto a regional Paleozoic or Mesozoic extensionalevent. Basement rocks along the transect are dominantly metavolcanic, metasedimentary,or intrusive units probably representinga Paleozoic accretionaryprism and arc complex. The extentto which Cenozoic uplift has been accommodated by reactivation of older structures and inversion of older basins is unknown and will require further study. As previously suggested by others, Cenozoic uplift of the Altai is interpretedto be due to NE-SW directedcompressionasl tress resulting from the Indo-Eurasian collision 2500 km to the south.},

The modern range formed within crust constructed by successive terrane accretion and ocean suturing events and widespread granite plutonism throughout the Palaeozoic. Modern reactivation of the Gobi Altai crust and the kinematics of Quaternary faults are fundamentally controlled by Palaeozoic basement structural trends, the location of rigid Precambrian blocks, orientation of SHmax and possible thermal weakening of the lower crust as a result of an extensive history of Mesozoic\textendash Cenozoic basaltic volcanism in the region, and the presence of thermally elevated asthenosphere under the Hangay Dome to the north. Modern mountain building processes in the Gobi Altai typically involve reactivation of NW\textendash{} SE-striking basement structures in thrust mode and development of linking east\textendash west left-lateral strike-slip faults that crosscut basement structures within an overall left-lateral transpressional regime. Restraining bends, other transpressional ridges and thrust basement blocks are the main range type, but are discontinuously distributed and separated by internally drained basins filling with modern alluvial deposits. Unlike a contractional thrust belt, there is no orogenic foreland or hinterland, and thrusts are both NE and SW directed with no evidence for a basal de\textasciiacute collement. Normal faults related to widespread Cretaceous rifting in the region appear to be unfavourably oriented for Late Cenozoic reactivation despite widespread topographic inversion of Cretaceous basin sequences. Because the Gobi Altai is an actively developing youthful mountain range in an arid region with low erosion rates, it provides an excellent opportunity to study the way in which a continental interior reactivates as a result a distant continental collision. In addition, it offers important insights into how other more advanced intracontinental transpressional orogens may have developed during earlier stages of their evolution.},

The FMM is a somewhat difficult application for parallel computing because of its tree structure and the fact that it requires many complex operations which are not regularly structured. Computational linear algebra with dense matrices for example allows many optimizations that leverage the regular computation pattern. FMM can be similarly optimized but we will see that the complexity of the optimization steps is greater. The discussion will start with a general presentation of FMMs. We briefly discuss parallel methods for the FMM, such as building the FMM tree in parallel, and reducing communication during the FMM procedure. Finally, we will focus on porting and optimizing the FMM on GPUs.},

  abstract = {A central challenge to many fields of science and engineering involves minimizing non-convex error functions over continuous, high dimensional spaces. Gradient descent or quasi-Newton methods are almost ubiquitously used to perform such minimizations, and it is often thought that a main source of difficulty for these local methods to find the global minimum is the proliferation of local minima with much higher error than the global minimum. Here we argue, based on results from statistical physics, random matrix theory, neural network theory, and empirical evidence, that a deeper and more profound difficulty originates from the proliferation of saddle points, not local minima, especially in high dimensional problems of practical interest. Such saddle points are surrounded by high error plateaus that can dramatically slow down learning, and give the illusory impression of the existence of a local minimum. Motivated by these arguments, we propose a new approach to second-order optimization, the saddle-free Newton method, that can rapidly escape high dimensional saddle points, unlike gradient descent and quasi-Newton methods. We apply this algorithm to deep or recurrent neural network training, and provide numerical evidence for its superior optimization performance.},

By employing a novel estimate for the errors incurred in this process, I minimise the computational effort required for a given accuracy and obtain a well-behaved distribution of force errors. For relative force errors of {$\sim$} 10\textendash 7, the computational costs exhibit an empirical scaling of {$\propto$} N0.87.

These effects are well-described by empirical rate- and state-dependent constitutive formulations which have been utilized for analysis of fault slip and earthquake processes. We present a procedure for direct quantitative microscopic observation of frictional contacts during slip. The observations reveal that frictional state dependence represents an increase of contact area with contact age. Transient changes of sliding resistance correlate with changes in contact area and arise from shifts of contact population age. Displacement-dependent replacement of contact populations is shown to cause the diagnostic evolution of friction over a characteristic sliding distance that occurs whenever slip begins or sliding conditions change.},

  abstract = {An unusual late Neoproterozoic (c. 572 Ma) ophiolite is exposed in the Dariv Range (western Mongolia), which contains intermediate to acidic lavas and sheeted dykes, and an igneous layered complex consisting of gabbro\textendash norites, websterites, orthopyroxenites and dunites underlain by serpentinized mantle harzburgites. Based on the compositions of the crustal units and the crystallization sequences in the mafic and ultramafic cumulates we conclude that the entire oceanic crust, including the cumulates, was made from arc magmas with boninitic characteristics. The Dariv rocks bear a strong resemblance to rocks recovered from the modern Izu\textendash Bonin\textendash Mariana fore-arc, a fragment of proto-arc oceanic basement, and we propose that the Dariv Ophiolite originated in a similar tectonic setting. A metamorphic complex consisting of amphibolite- to granulite-facies metasedimentary and meta-igneous rocks was thrust over the ophiolite. This metamorphic complex probably represents a Cambrian arc. Thrusting started before 514.7 \AE{} 7.6 Ma as constrained by new sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe U\textendash Pb zircon analyses from a syn- to post-tectonic diorite. The Dariv Ophiolite is a type-example of a proto-arc ophiolite, a special class of supra-subduction zone ophiolites.},

High order spatial accuracy is obtained through a WENO reconstruction, while a high order one-step time discretization is achieved using a local space-time discontinuous Galerkin predictor method. Due to the one-step nature of the underlying scheme, the resulting algorithm is particularly well suited for an AMR strategy on space-time adaptive meshes, i.e.with time-accurate local time stepping. The AMR property has been implemented 'cell-by-cell', with a standard tree-type algorithm, while the scheme has been parallelized via the Message Passing Interface (MPI) paradigm. The new scheme has been tested over a wide range of examples for nonlinear systems of hyperbolic conservation laws, including the classical Euler equations of compressible gas dynamics and the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). High order in space and time have been confirmed via a numerical convergence study and a detailed analysis of the computational speed-up with respect to highly refined uniform meshes is also presented. We also show test problems where the presented high order AMR scheme behaves clearly better than traditional second order AMR methods. The proposed scheme that combines for the first time high order ADER methods with space\textendash time adaptive grids in two and three space dimensions is likely to become a useful tool in several fields of computational physics, applied mathematics and mechanics.},

The key point is a new reconstruction operator that makes use of techniques developed originally in the discontinuous Galerkin finite element framework. First, we use a hierarchical orthogonal basis to perform reconstruction. Second, reconstruction is not done in physical coordinates, but in a reference coordinate system which eliminates scaling effects and thus avoids ill-conditioned reconstruction matrices. In order to achieve non-oscillatory properties, we propose a new WENO reconstruction technique that does not reconstruct point-values but entire polynomials which can easily be evaluated and differentiated at any point. We show that due to the special reconstruction the WENO oscillation indicator can be computed in a mesh-independent manner by a simple quadratic functional. Our WENO scheme does not suffer from the problem of negative weights as previously described in the literature, since the linear weights are not used to increase accuracy. Accuracy is obtained by merely putting a large linear weight on the central stencil. The resulting one-step ADER finite volume scheme obtained in this way performs only one nonlinear WENO reconstruction per element and time step and thus can be implemented very efficiently even for unstructured grids in three space dimensions. We show convergence results obtained with the proposed method up to sixth order in space and time on unstructured triangular and tetrahedral grids in two and three space dimensions, respectively.},

  abstract = {This article describes the extension of the arbitrary high-order Discontinuous Galerkin (ADERDG) method to treat locally varying polynomial degress of the basis functions, so-called p-adaptivity, as well as locally varying time steps that may be different from one element to another. The p-adaptive version of the scheme is useful in complex 3-D models with small-scale features which have to be meshed with reasonably small elements to capture the necessary geometrical details of interest. Using a constant high polynomial degree of the basis functions in the whole computational domain can lead to an unreasonably high CPU effort since good spatial resolution at the surface may be already obtained by the fine mesh. Therefore, it can be more adequate in some cases to use a lower order method in the small elements to reduce the CPU effort without loosing much accuracy. To further increase computational efficiency, we present a new local time stepping (LTS) algorithm. For usual explicit time stepping schemes the element with the smallest time step resulting from the stability criterion of the method will dictate its time step to all the other elements of the computational domain. In contrast, by using local time stepping, each element can use its optimal time step given by the local stability condition. Our proposed LTS algorithm for ADER-DG is very general and does not need any temporal synchronization between the elements. Due to the ADER approach, accurate time interpolation is automatically provided at the element interfaces such that the computational overhead is very small and such that the method maintains the uniform high order of accuracy in space and time as in the usual ADER-DG schemes with a globally constant time step. However, the LTS ADER-DG method is computationally much more efficient for problems with strongly varying element size or material parameters since it allows to reduce the total number of element updates considerably. This holds especially for unstructured tetrahedral meshes that contain strongly degenerate elements, so-called slivers. We show numerical convergence results and CPU times for LTS ADER-DG schemes up to sixth order in space and time on irregular tetrahedral meshes containing elements of very different size and also on tetrahedral meshes containing slivers. Further validation of the algorithm is provided by results obtained for the layer over half-space (LOH.1) benchmark problem proposed by the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center. Finally, we present a realistic application on earthquake modelling and ground motion prediction for the alpine valley of Grenoble.},

  abstract = {We present a new numerical method to solve the heterogeneous anelastic seismic wave equations with arbitrary high order of accuracy in space and time on unstructured triangular and tetrahedral meshes in two and three space dimensions, respectively. Using the velocity\textendash stress formulation provides a linear hyperbolic system of equations with source terms that is completed by additional equations for the anelastic functions including the strain history of the material. These additional equations result from the rheological model of the generalized Maxwell body and permit the incorporation of realistic attenuation properties of viscoelastic material accounting for the behaviour of elastic solids and viscous fluids. The proposed method relies on the finite volume (FV) approach where cell-averaged quantities are evolved in time by computing numerical fluxes at the element interfaces. The basic ingredient of the numerical flux function is the solution of Generalized Riemann Problems at the element interfaces according to the arbitrary high-order derivatives (ADER) approach of Toro et al., where the initial data is piecewise polynomial instead of piecewise constant as it was in the original first-order FV scheme developed by Godunov. The ADER approach automatically produces a scheme of uniformly high order of accuracy in space and time. The high-order polynomials in space, needed as input for the numerical flux function, are obtained using a reconstruction operator acting on the cell averages. This reconstruction operator uses some techniques originally developed in the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) Finite Element framework, namely hierarchical orthogonal basis functions in a reference element. In particular, in this article we pay special attention to underline the differences as well as the points in common with the ADER-DG schemes previously developed by the authors, especially concerning the MPI parallelization of both methods.},

  abstract = {In this article, we propose a new class of finite volume schemes of arbitrary accuracy in space and time for systems of hyperbolic balance laws with stiff source terms. The new class of schemes is based on a three stage procedure. First a highorder WENO reconstruction procedure is applied to the cell averages at the current time level. Second, the temporal evolution of the reconstruction polynomials is computed locally inside each cell using the governing equations. In the original ENO scheme of Harten et al. and in the ADER schemes of Titarev and Toro, this time evolution is achieved via a Taylor series expansion where the time derivatives are computed by repeated differentiation of the governing PDE with respect to space and time, i.e. by applying the so-called Cauchy\textendash Kovalewski procedure. However, this approach is not able to handle stiff source terms. Therefore, we present a new strategy that only replaces the Cauchy\textendash Kovalewski procedure compared to the previously mentioned schemes. For the time-evolution part of the algorithm, we introduce a local space\textendash time discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element scheme that is able to handle also stiff source terms. This step is the only part of the algorithm which is locally implicit. The third and last step of the proposed ADER finite volume schemes consists of the standard explicit space\textendash time integration over each control volume, using the local space\textendash time DG solutions at the Gaussian integration points for the intercell fluxes and for the space\textendash time integral over the source term. We will show numerical convergence studies for nonlinear systems in one space dimension with both non-stiff and with very stiff source terms up to sixth order of accuracy in space and time. The application of the new method to a large set of different test cases is shown, in particular the stiff scalar model problem of LeVeque and Yee [R.J. LeVeque, H.C. Yee, A study of numerical methods for hyperbolic conservation laws with stiff source terms, Journal of Computational Physics 86 (1) (1990) 187\textendash 210], the relaxation system of Jin and Xin [S.

The time evolution of these data and the flux computation, however, are then done with a different set of piecewise polynomials of degree M P N , which are reconstructed from the underlying polynomials of degree N. This approach yields a general, unified framework that contains as two special cases classical high order finite volume (FV) schemes \dh N {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0\TH{} as well as the usual discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method \dh N {$\frac{1}{4}$} M\TH. In the first case, the polynomial is reconstructed from cell averages, for the latter, the reconstruction reduces to the identity operator.

For functions tabulated at Chebyshev nodes on an interval, spectral interpolation and indefinite integration can be performed stably and efficiently via the fast Fourier transform. For many other sets of nodes (such as the Gaussian nodes on an interval) the classical interpolation and indefinite integration schemes are stable but slow, requiting O(N2) arithmetic operations with N the number of nodes in the discretization of the interval. In this paper, a group of algorithms is presented for the efficient evaluation of Lagrange polynomial interpolants at multiple points on the line and for the rapid indefinite integration and differentiation of functions tabulated at nodes other than Chebyshev. The interpolation scheme requires O (N. log( /e) arithmetic operations, and O (N. log N + N. log( /e) operations are required for the integration and differentiation schemes, where e is the precision of computations and N is the number of nodes (the interpolation and integration schemes are stable while the differentiation scheme has a condition number proportional to N2). The algorithms utilize efficient versions of the fast multipole method which have been designed specifically for one-dimensional problems; these are also described in the present paper. Several experiments are included to illustrate the numerical performance of the approach.},

The flow of a thin sheet of power law material overlying an inviscid substrate is studied under the assumption that vertical gradients of the horizontal velocity are negligible. A numerical model is used to investigate the deformation of such a sheet under conditions approximating those of continent-continent collision. The material flows in response to forces applied to its boundaries (for example, the indenting of one continent by another) and t o forces in its interior arising from gradients in crustal thickness. The horizontal divergence of the flow produces changes in the crustal thickness and hence a time-dependent form to the flow itself. For a given set of boundary conditions, the flow depends on the stress exponent in the power law rheology, n, and on the Argand number\& which is a measure of the ratio between the stress arising from crustal thickness contrasts and the stress required to deform the material at the ambient strain rates. When the effective viscosity of the medium is very high (Ar-+O), crustal thickness variations do not influence the flow. If the material is Newtonian (n = l), the deformation associated with an influx of material (approximating an indenter) is of much greater lateral dimension than the width of the indenter, whereas when material has a power law rheology (n= 3, 5 are used), the deformation is confined to a region of lateral extent comparable to that of the indenter. As A r increases, the forces arising from crustal thickness contrasts exert more influence on the flow, and the maximum crustal thickness that can be sustained by a given influx of material is related by a simple expression to the effective viscosity of the medium at the ambient strain rates. In the limit of a very weak medium (Ar{$>$} 10)the lithosphere is unable to sustain appreciable crustal elevation contrasts. The results of these numerical experiments show that systems in which the effective viscosities are such that the maximum deviatoric stresses are between 1kbar *-sent address: Department of Geological Sciences, Harvard University, 20 Oxford Street, Cambridge., wurachusetts 02138, USA.},

Rational quadrature can handle the presence of corners and triple-junctions in a more accurate manner than can polynomial quadrature. A preconditioner is also included in the scheme. The rational quadrature together with the preconditioner results in a scheme that reduces the number of discretization points needed for a certain accuracy by up to 70\% and the number of iterations needed by an iterative solver by up to 50\%, compared to a scheme using only polynomial quadrature. For validation, several setups with a single edge crack are studied. Larger setups containing up to 1500 edge cracks are also investigated. Copyright q 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {We present an efficient numerical method for earthquake cycle simulations that employs a finite difference discretization of the off-fault material to accommodate spatially variable elastic properties. The method is developed for the two-dimensional antiplane shear problem of a vertical strike-slip fault with rate-and-state friction. We compare earthquake cycles in a homogeneous half-space with those in which the upper portion of the fault cuts through a sedimentary basin. In both cases, we assume velocity-weakening behavior over the full seismogenic depth, even in the basin, to isolate the influence of elastic heterogeneity. In a homogeneous half-space, events rupturing the full seismogenic depth occur periodically. Event sequences are more complex in basin models, with one or several subbasin events confined to the lower section of the fault followed by a much larger, surface-rupturing event that breaks through the basin. This phenomenology emerges only for sufficiently compliant and deep basins. Predicted surface velocities are essentially identical before subbasin events and surface-rupturing events, suggesting that geodetic observations would not be useful in predicting the rupture mode. The alternating sequence of subbasin and surface-rupturing events would complicate interpretation of paleoseismic data. Our results also offer one potential explanation for the shallow slip deficit observed in many recent earthquakes, namely, that these events, which lack appreciable surface slip, are simply one style of rupture. Subsequent events on these faults might be larger, with slip extending all the way to the surface. The 1940 Mw 7.0 and 1979 Mw 6.5 Imperial Valley events might be considered as examples of these two rupture styles.},

  abstract = {We present a discontinuous Galerkin finite-element method (DG-FEM) formulation with Convolutional Perfectly Matched Layer (CPML) absorbing boundary condition for 3-D elastic seismic wave modelling. This method makes use of unstructured tetrahedral meshes locally refined according to the medium properties (h-adaptivity), and of approximation orders that can change from one element to another according to an adequate criterion (p-adaptivity). These two features allow us to significantly reduce the computational cost of the simulations. Moreover, we have designed an efficient CPML absorbing boundary condition, both in terms of absorption and computational cost, by combining approximation orders in the numerical domain. A quadratic interpolation is typically used in the medium to obtain the required accuracy, while lower approximation orders are used in the CPMLs to reduce the total computational cost and to obtain a well-balanced workload over the processors. While the efficiency of DG-FEMs have been largely demonstrated for high approximation orders, we favour the use of low approximation orders as they are more appropriate to the applications we are interested in. In particular, we address the issues of seismic modelling and seismic imaging in cases of complex geological structures that require a fine discretization of the medium. We illustrate the efficiency of our approach within the framework of the EUROSEISTEST verification and validation project, which is designed to compare highfrequency (up to 4 Hz) numerical predictions of ground motion in the Volvi basin (Greece). Through the tetrahedral meshing, we have achieved fine discretization of the basin, which appears to be a sine qua non condition for accurate computation of surface waves diffracted at the basin edges. We compare our results with predictions computed with the spectral element method (SEM), and demonstrate that our method yields the same level of accuracy with computation times of the same order of magnitude.},

From the low-frequency images, we resolve an initial slow downdip (northward) rupture near the nucleation area for the first 20 s (Stage 1), followed by two faster updip ruptures (20 to 40 s for Stage 2 and 40 to 55 s for Stage 3), which released most of the radiated energy northeast of Kathmandu. The centroid rupture power from LF backprojection agrees well with the Global Centroid Moment Tensor solution. The spatial resolution of the backprojection images is validated by applying similar analysis to nearby aftershocks. The overall rupture pattern agrees well with the aftershock distribution. A multiple-asperity model could explain the observed multistage rupture and aftershock distribution.},

The experiment was designed to allow a multiplatform and multigeometry analysis, i.e., each reflector was carefully pointed in order to be visible in both Envisat and Radarsat acquisitions. Moreover, two pairs of reflectors were used to allow the combination of data gathered along ascending and descending orbits. The standard deviation of the error is 0.75 mm in the vertical direction and 0.58 mm in the horizontal (EW) direction. GPS data were also collected during this experiment in order to cross-check the SAR results.},

  abstract = {Field observations of pseudotachylites, and experimental studies of high-speed friction indicate that melting on a slipping interface may significantly affect the magnitude of shear stresses resisting slip. We investigate the effects of rock melting on the dynamic friction using theoretical models of shear heating that couple heat transfer, thermodynamics of phase transitions, and fluid mechanics. Results of laboratory experiments conducted at high (order of m/s) slip velocities but low (order of MPa) normal stresses suggest that the onset of frictional melting may give rise to substantial increases in the effective fault strength, presumably due to viscous effects. However, extrapolation of the modeling results to in situ conditions suggests that the efficiency of viscous braking is significantly reduced under high normal and shear stresses. When transient increases in the dynamic fault strength due to fusion are not sufficient to inhibit slip, decreases in the effective melt viscosity due to shear heating and melting of clasts drastically decrease the dynamic friction, resulting in a nearly complete stress drop (``thermal runaway''). The amount of energy dissipation associated with the formation of pseudotachylites is governed by the temperature dependence of melt viscosity, and the average clast size in the fault gouge prior to melting. Clasts from a coarsegrained gouge have lower chances of survival in a pseudotachylite due to a higher likelihood of non-equilibrium overheating. The maximum temperature and energy dissipation attainable on the fault surface are ultimately limited by either the rock solidus (via viscous braking, and slip arrest), or liquidus (via thermal runaway, and vanishing resistance to sliding). Our modeling results indicate that the thermally-activated fault strengthening and rupture arrest are unlikely to occur in most mafic protoliths, but might be relevant for quartz-rich rocks, especially at shallow ({$<$} 5-7 km) depths where the driving shear stress is relatively low.},

We use teleseismic waveforms with geodetic data from Global Positioning System, synthetic aperture radar interferometry and image amplitude correlation to produce a source model of this earthquake. The model describes evolution of fault slip during the earthquake. The geodetic data constrains the spatial distribution of fault slip and the seismic waveforms constrain mostly the time evolution of slip. We find that the earthquake started with largely thrust motion on an imbricate system of faults beneath the central Longmen Shan, including the Beichuan Fault and Pengguan Fault, with fault slip at depth extending up to 50 km northwest of the mountain front. The fault ruptures continued northeast along the Beichuan Fault with more oblique slip (right-lateral and thrust) and the proportion of lateral motion increasing in the northern Longmen Shan. The northernmost fault segment has a much steeper dip, consistent with nearly pure strike-slip motion. The kinematic source model shows that the rupture propagated to the northeast at about 2.5\textendash 3.0 km s-1, producing a cascade of subevents with a total duration of about 110 s.

Where viscosity is discontinuous, but the upper crust and mantle lithosphere have comparable maximum values, surface deformation can be used to approximate force balance and rheological parameters, but tradeoffs mean that estimates of stress and viscosity are effective equivalent values rather than actual values. Where viscosity is both discontinuous and differs by much more than an order of magnitude between the upper crust and mantle lithosphere, information about both force balance and rheology are absent from the surface deformation, so surface observations alone are insufficient to estimate either the dynamic or mechanical state of the lithosphere.},

This is quite different from many fast multipole methods which depend on analytical expansions of the far-field behavior of K, for jx \`A yj large. Other ``black-box'' or ``kernel-independent'' fast multipole methods have been devised. Our approach has the advantage of requiring a small pre-computation time even for very large systems, and uses the minimal number of coefficients to represent the far-field, for a given L2 tolerance error in the approximation. This technique can be very useful for problems where the kernel is known analytically but is quite complicated, or for kernels which are defined purely numerically.},

  abstract = {A number of possible mechanismshave recently been proposed for driving the motions of the lithospheric plates, such as pushing from mid-ocean ridges, pulling by downgoing slabs, suction toward trenches, and coupling of the plates to flow in the mantle. We advancea new observationalmethod of testing these theories of the driving mechanism. Our basic approach is to solve the inverse problem of determining the relative strength of the plausible driving forces, given the observed motions and geometries of the lithospheric plates. Since the inertia of the plates is negligible, each plate must be in dynamicequilibrium,so that the sum of the torques acting on a plate must be zero. Thus, our problem is to determine the relative sizes of the forces that minimize the components of net torque on each plate. The results indicate that the forces acting on the downgoing slab control the velocity of the oceanic plates and are an order of magnitude stronger than any other force. Namely, all the oceanic plates attached to substantial amounts of downgoing slabs move with a ' terminal velocity ' at which the gravitational body force pulling the slabs downward is nearly balanced with the resistanceacting on the slab; regardless of the other features of the trailing horizontal part of the plates. The drag on the bottom of the plates which resist motion is stronger under the continents than under the oceans.},

Global Positioning System (GPS) data suggest that {$\sim$}10\textendash 15 per cent of total Indo-Asia convergence is accommodated across this orogen. The Ho\textasciidieresis h Serh\textendash Tsagaan Salaa fault system is one of several NNW\textendash SSE-trending oblique contractional faults acting to partition strain and accommodate shortening and dextral shear in the Mongolian Altai. This fault zone displaces late Pleistocene alluvium along the southwest piedmont of the Ho\textasciidieresis h Serh range in western Mongolia. Along the central third of the fault zone, strain is partitioned onto two separate strands, one that accommodates nearly pure dextral shear and one that accommodates thrust motion. We determined late Pleistocene rates of deformation along each of the Ho\textasciidieresis h Serh\textendash Tsagaan Salaa fault strands based on differential GPS surveys and cosmogenic nuclide 10Be geochronology. Combining the measured offsets and 10Be dates yields a minimum right-lateral slip rate of 0.9 +0.2/-0.1 mm a-1; the minimum shortening rate is 0.3 {$\pm$} 0.1 mm a-1, with uplift of at least 0.1 {$\pm$} 0.1 mm a-1. Resolving the shortening and dextral components of deformation yields a slip vector of 0.8 +0.2/-0.1 mm a-1 toward 336{$\smwhtcircle$}. This long-term deformation vector is consistent with the short-term strain field determined by GPS in the region and indicates that {$\sim$}20 per cent of Indo-Asian deformation in the Mongolian Altai ({$\sim$}2 per cent of the total Indo-Asia strain accumulation) occurs along the Ho\textasciidieresis h Serh\textendash Tsagaan Salaa fault zone. Although rate data for other active faults in the Mongolian Altai are sparse, our results suggest that strain may be accommodated almost exclusively on discrete structures in this intraplate tectonic setting.},

From south to north, these three new sites are: South Mud Canyon, Cucomongo Canyon, and Indian Creek. Slip rates were determined by combining offsets measured with 1-m-resolution airborne lidar data with 10Be cosmogenic nuclide surface exposure and optically stimulated luminescence ages from displaced alluvial fans. The offset fans date to 17.4 {$\pm$} 2.3 ka at South Mud Canyon, 39 {$\pm$} 3 ka at Cucomongo Canyon, and 6.3 {$\pm$} 1.8 ka at Indian Creek, yielding slip rates of 2.1 + 0.5/-0.4 mm/yr, 6.1 + 1.3/-1.0 mm/yr and 2.2 + 0.8/-0.6 mm/yr, respectively. At Indian Creek, the Holocene (\textasciitilde 6 ka) and late Quaternary (\textasciitilde{} 70 ka) slip rates are the same, within uncertainty, suggesting temporal constancy of seismic strain release along the northern DVFLV fault zone over these time spans. When combined with slip rates determined in earlier companion studies, these results show that the late Quaternary slip rate decreases northward and southward from the central part of the fault, as slip is transferred onto north-trending zones of distributed normal faulting towards the northeast and southwest of the central zone of rapid deformation. This complex pattern of strain accommodation may reflect structural evolution towards a straighter, structurally simpler zone of dextral shear that locally utilizes well-established dextral faults that are linked where necessary by nascent zones of deformation. Summation of the rates of all major faults in the eastern California shear zone (ECSZ) at the 37\textdegree N latitude of Red Wall Canyon in northern Death Valley shows that the cumulative geologic rate of \textasciitilde 8.5\textendash 10 mm/yr is indistinguishable from the \textasciitilde{} 9 mm/ yr geodetic rate. Although the cumulative rate on the major faults of the ECSZ is slower to the north and south, this probably reflects more distributed deformation in these areas, rather than transient strain accumulation. These results demonstrate the importance of obtaining multiple slip rates to effectively document the behavior of any fault system, especially in studies of seismic hazard assessment and comparisons of geologic and geodetic rate data.},

  abstract = {The seismicity of southern California results from stresses that arise from the relative motion of the Pacific and North American Plates being accommodated along the San Andreas Fault (SAF) system and the Eastern California Shear Zone (ECSZ). Here we calculate how the stress field in southern California has evolved over the past two centuries due to interseismic loading, as inferred from current GPS observations of surface velocities, from redistributions of static stress induced by large (M w {$\geq$} 6.5) earthquakes since the 1812 Wrightwood quake, and postseismic viscoelastic relaxation associated with these events that serves to transfer coseismic stresses from the deep, warm, lower crust and upper mantle to the overlying seismogenic upper crust. We calculate Coulomb stress changes on vertical strike-slip faults striking parallel to the SAF and at the hypocenters on the rupture planes of all M w {$\geq$} 6 events over the past two centuries. Our results suggest that the 1857 M w = 8.2 Fort Tejon earthquake, by far the largest event to have occurred in the region over the past two centuries, had a profound influence on the state of stress in Southern California during the 19th century, inducing significant stress increases to the north (Parkfield region and adjoining creeping SAF) and south (southern SAF and San Jacinto fault), and stress relief across the southern ECSZ. These stress changes were then greatly magnified by postseismic relaxation through the early part of the 20th century. Slow interseismic build-up of stress further loads all major strike-slip faults and works to reload the areas of the ECSZ where stress was relieved by the 1857 quake. Our calculations suggest that only 56\% of hypocenters were pushed closer to failure by preceding coseismic stress changes, suggesting that the occurrence of large earthquakes is not strongly determined by coseismic Coulomb stress changes. This percentage rises to 70\% when postseismic stress changes are also considered. Our calculations demonstrate the importance of postseismic viscoelastic relaxation in the redistribution of stress following large earthquakes. We find, however, that postseismic processes associated with events more than about a decade old are near completion and thus do not significantly influence the regional velocity field presently observed in southern California.},

This is accomplished using rate changes in GPS observed displacement time-series at far-field stations as constraints on the parameters associated with laboratory derived temperature- and stress-dependent flow laws for diffusion and dislocation creep of olivine. We primarily concentrate on the influences of temperature, grain size, and background strain rate to explain observed fast early displacement rates that slow rapidly in the 7 years of postseismic observations. We find that a reasonable fit to the observed time-series cannot be achieved by any combination of flow law parameters and plausible assumptions for the tectonic environment of the mantle beneath the Mojave Desert. We conclude that postseismic relaxation within the mantle following the Hector Mine earthquake likely includes an initial transient weakening phase, suggesting that steady-state flow laws by themselves are insufficient to characterize the flow of mantle rocks when stress conditions evolve.},

A linear viscous mantle cannot explain fast early displacement rates at the surface that rapidly decay with time, whereas a power-law rheology where strain rate is proportional to stress raised to the power of 3.5 {$\pm$} 0.5 provides decay rates and spatial patterns in agreement with observations. This is consistent with laboratory measurements for hot, wet olivine, implying a hydrated mantle and a relatively thin (60-km-thick) lithosphere beneath south-central Alaska. These results suggest that the viscous strength of the lithosphere varies both spatially and temporally, and that effective viscosities inferred from different loading events or observational time-periods can differ by up to several orders of magnitude. Thus, the very conditions that enable the inference of rheologic strength\textendash transient loading and unloading events\textendash significantly alter the effective viscosity.},

However, it can fail completely for the layer potentials belonging to the modified Helmholtz, biharmonic and Stokes equations. These equations depend on a parameter, denoted {$\alpha$}, and kernel-split quadrature loses its accuracy rapidly when this parameter grows beyond a certain threshold. The present report describes an algorithm that remedies this problem, using per-target adaptive sampling of the source geometry. The refinement is carried out through recursive bisection, with a carefully selected rule set. This maintains accuracy for a wide range of {$\alpha$}, at an increased cost that scales as log {$\alpha$}. Using this algorithm allows kernel-split quadrature to be both accurate and efficient for a much wider range of problems than previously possible.},

To overcome this disadvantage, in this paper, a convolution quadrature method (CQM) is applied to the time-discretization of boundary integral equations in 2-D and 3-D general anisotropic solids. As numerical examples, the problems of elastic wave scattering by a cavity are solved to validate the present method.},

  abstract = {Current theories regarding the connections and feedbacks between surface and tectonic processes are predicated on the assumption that higher rainfall causes more rapid erosion. To test this assumption in a tectonically active landscape, a network of 10 river monitoring stations was established in the High Himalayas of central Nepal across a steep rainfall gradient. Suspended sediment flux was calculated from sampled suspended sediment concentrations and discharge rating curves. Accounting for solute and bedload contributions, the suspended sediment fluxes were used to calculate watershed-scale erosion rates that were then compared to monsoon precipitation and specific discharge. We find that, in individual watersheds, annual erosion rates increase with runoff. In addition, our data suggest average erosion rate increases with discharge and precipitation across the entire field site such that the wetter southern watersheds are eroding faster than the drier northern watersheds. The spatially non-uniform contemporary erosion rates documented here are at odds with other studies that have found spatially uniform long-term rates (105\textendash 106 yr) across the pronounced rainfall gradient observed in the region. The discrepancy between the modern rates measured here and the long-term rates may be reconciled by considering the high erosional efficiency of glaciers. The northern catchments were much more extensively glacierized during the Pleistocene, and therefore, they likely experienced erosion rates that were significantly higher than the modern rates. We propose that, in the northern watersheds, the high rates of erosion during periods of glaciation compensate for the low rates during interglacials to produce a time-averaged rate comparable to the landslide-dominated southern catchments.},

These problems arise as Newton iterates for a certain nonlinear model problem deriving from finite elasticity, which exhibits a mechanism under which a deformed body undergoes a degenerate form of cavitation. The unit ball represents an elastic body, with the small ball representing a "core region," which is mapped to a cavity by the (possibly large) deformation. This deformation satisfies the (vector) Laplace equation in the body minus the core region, together with a Dirichlet condition on the outer boundary and a nonlinear Neumann condition on the inner boundary. Newton's method yields a sequence of linear problems that are reformulated as a 6 x 6 coupled system of boundary integral equations. The authors introduce a pseudospectral (discrete global Galerkin) method for this system, using the spherical harmonics as basis functions. By extending the known approximation theory for spherical polynomials it is proved that this method converges faster than any power of n when the number of degrees of freedom is O((n + 1)2). As well as providing a convergence theory for this boundary value problem, the paper also contains a number of new results on spherical polynomial approximation and on the convergence of the pseudospectral method for classical integral equations of 3D potential theory on spheres.},

The predictor remains local taking into account the time evolution of the data only within the grid cell. Based on a space\textendash time Taylor expansion, this idea is already inherent in the MUSCL finite volume scheme to get second order accuracy in time and was generalized in the context of higher order ENO finite volume schemes. We interpret the space\textendash time Taylor expansion used in this approach as a local predictor and conclude that other space\textendash time approximate solutions of the local Cauchy problem in the grid cell may be applied. Three possibilities are considered in this paper: (1) the classical space\textendash time Taylor expansion, in which time derivatives are obtained from known space-derivatives by the Cauchy\textendash Kovalewsky procedure; (2) a local continuous extension Runge\textendash Kutta scheme and (3) a local space\textendash time Galerkin predictor with a version suitable for stiff source terms. The advantage of the predictor\textendash corrector formulation is that the time evolution is done in one step which establishes optimal locality during the whole time step. This time discretization scheme can be used within all schemes which are based on a piecewise continuous approximation as finite volume schemes, discontinuous Galerkin schemes or the recently proposed reconstructed discontinuous Galerkin or PNPM schemes. The implementation of these approaches is described, advantages and disadvantages of different predictors are discussed and numerical results are shown.},

  abstract = {We present a numerical formulation for three-dimensional elastodynamic problems of fracture on planar cracks and faults. Stress and displacement components are given a spectral representation as finite Fourier series in space coordinates parallel to the fracture plane. The formulation is based on an exact representation, involving a convolution integral for each Fourier mode, of the elastodynamic relation existing between the time-dependent Fourier coefficients for the tractions acting on the fracture plane and for the resulting displacement discontinuities. A wide range of constitutive models can be used to relate the local value of the strength on the fracture plane with the displacement and velocity history. Efficiency of the code is achieved by using an explicit time integration scheme and by computing the conversion between the spatial and spectral distributions through a FFT algorithm. The method is particularly suited to implementation on massively parallel computers ; a CM-5 was used in this work. The stability and precision of the formulation are discussed for tensile (mode I) situations in a detailed modal analysis, and numerical results are compared with existing three-dimensional elastodynamic solutions. The adequacy of the method to investigate various three-dimensional dynamic fracture problems involving non-propagating and propagating tensile cracks is illustrated, including crack growth along a plane of heterogeneous fracture toughness.},

We have tested all of the methods with different source distributions. Our results show that FFT is the method of choice for smooth source functions that can be resolved with a uniform mesh.

The obtained singular function expansions replace the Taylor and Laurent expansions used in the original FMM. The algorithm requires O(N ) operations and is stable and robust.

  abstract = {A general boundary layer theory for thermoviscoplastic solids which accounts for inertia. rate sensitivity. hardening, thermal coupling, heat convection and conduction, and thermal softening is developed. In many applications of interest, the boundary layer equations can be considerably simplified by recourse to similarity methods, which facilitates the determination of steady-state and transient fully non-linear twodimensional solutions. A simple analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the steady-state solutions leads to a classification of stable and unstable regimes. Under adiabatic conditions, the resulting material stability criterion coincides with that previously derived by Molinari and Clifton [( 1987) Analytical characterization of shear localization in thermoviscoplastic solids. J. Appl. Mech. 54, 806-8121 by a quasi-static, onedimensional analysis. The transition from initially stable to unstable behavior can also be conveniently described by similarity methods. This provides a powerful semi-analytical tool for the interpretation of impact tests exhibiting dynamic shear bands, and for the characterization of the two-dimensional structure of such bands. It follows from the theory that, if the velocity of the impactor is held steady, the leading tip of the shear band propagates at a constant speed. This shear band tip speed follows readily from the theory as a function of the impact velocity and material parameters. The two-dimensional velocity. stress. temperature and plastic work fields attendant to the propagating shear band are also determined.},

  abstract = {Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multilayer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future. We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1. Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.},

We remotely measured surface deformation associated with this event using highresolution (0.5 m) pre- and post-event satellite optical imagery. We document left lateral, near-field, on-fault offsets (10 m from fault) using 309 laterally offset piercing points, such as streams, terrace risers, and roads. Peak near-field displacement is 13.6 +2.5/-3.4 m. We characterize off-fault deformation by measuring medium(b350 m from fault) and far-field (N 350 m from fault) displacement using manual (259 measurements) and automated image cross-correlation methods, respectively. Off-fault peak lateral displacement values are \textasciitilde 15 m and exceed on-fault displacement magnitudes for \textasciitilde 85\% of the rupture length. Our observations suggest that for this rupture, coseismic surface displacement typically increases with distance away from the surface trace of the fault; however, nearly 100\% of total surface displacement occurs within a few hundred meters of the primary fault trace. Furthermore, off-fault displacement accounts for, on average, 28\% of the total displacement but exhibits a highly heterogeneous along-strike pattern. The best agreement between near-field and far-field displacements generally corresponds to the narrowest fault zone widths. Our analysis demonstrates significant and heterogeneous mismatches between on- and off-fault coseismic deformation, and we conclude that this phenomenon should be considered in hazard models based on geologically determined on-fault slip rates.},

Experiments are constrainedby subtle topography and the distribution of seismicity in the region. We use a new boundary element algorithm that permits calculation of the three-dimensionaldeformation field. Surface displacementfields are calculated for the New Madrid zone under both far-field (plate tectonic scale) and locally derived driving strains. Results demonstratethat surface displacementfields cannot distinguish between either a far-field simple or pure shear strain field or one that involves a deep shearzone beneath the upper crustal faults. Thus, neither geomorphicnor geodetic studiesalone are expected to reveal the ultimate driving mechanismbehind the present-day deformation. We have also tested hypothesesabout strain accommodation within the New Madrid contractional step-over by including linking faults, two southwestdipping and one vertical, recently inferred from microearthquake data. Only those models with step-over faults are able to predict the observed topography. Surface displacementfields for long-term, relaxed deformation predict the distribution of uplift and subsidencein the contractional step-over remarkably well. Generation of these displacementfields appear to require slip on both the two northeasttrending vertical faults and the two dipping faults in the step-over region, with very minor displacements occurringduring the interseismicperiod when the northeasttrending vertical faults are locked. These models suggestthat the gently dipping central step-over fault is a reverse fault and that the steeper fault, extending to the southeastof the step-over, acts as a normal fault over the long term.},

Here we apply thin viscous sheet models, which have been successfully applied to deformation in several continental deforming zones, to investigate the deformation of oceanic lithosphere in the diffuse oceanic plate boundaries between the India, Capricorn, and Australia Plates. We apply kinematic boundary conditions based on the current motion between these plates. We neglect buoyancy forces due to plate thinning or thickening and assume that the thin viscous sheet has the same depth-integrated nonlinear viscosity coefficient everywhere. Our initial models have only one adjustable parameter, n, the power-law exponent, with n = 1, 3, 10, 30, and 100. The predicted width of the deforming zone decreases with increasing n, with n {$\geq$} 30 explaining the observations. This n value is higher than has been estimated for continental lithosphere and suggests that more of the strength of oceanic lithosphere lies in layers deforming by faulting or by dislocation glide than for continental lithosphere. To obtain a stress field that better fits the distribution and type of earthquake focal mechanisms in the diffuse oceanic plate boundary, we add a second adjustable parameter, representing the effect of slab pull stretching the oceanic plate near the Sumatra Trench. We show that an average velocity increment on this boundary segment of 5 mm a\`A1 (relative to the average velocity of the India and Australia Plates) fits the observed distribution of fault types better than velocities of 3.3 mm a\`A1 or 10 mm a\`A1.},

The low rank matrices are assembled by the ACA+ algorithm, an improved variant of the well-known ACA method. We present an algorithm that can determine a coarser block structure that minimises the storage requirements (enhanced compression) and speeds up the arithmetic (e.g., inversion) in the H-matrix format. This coarse approximation is done adaptively and on-the-fly to a given accuracy such that the matrix is assembled with minimal storage requirements while keeping the desired approximation quality.

A single analytic integration is employed for the edge and vertex singular integrals. This is sufficient to display the divergent term in the edge-adjacent integral and to show that the vertex integral is finite. By explicitly identifying the divergent quantities, we can compute the hypersingular integral without recourse to Stokes's theorem or the Hadamard finite part.

The integrals resulting from higher order curved interpolation are shown to be reducible to the linear case, and can therefore be treated with the same techniques. Example calculations employing the Symmetric-Galerkin approximation are presented for the Laplace equation and for orthotropic elasticity.

Our field observations and geochronological data constrain the main kinematic events in the Bhutan Himalayas. Crystallisation ages of leucogranite dykes deformed by the Main Central Thrust and the South Tibetan Detachment indicate that these two structures operated together between 16 and 22 Ma. The out-of-sequence Kakhtang thrust was active at 10\^14 Ma and was concurrent with reactivation of the South Tibetan Detachment. Restoration of the Bhutan Himalayas prior to the out-of-sequence thrusting shows that the Greater Himalayan Sequence was the core of a long, low-viscosity crustal channel extending under the Tibetan plateau. We propose that the gravity-driven southward extrusion of the channel material from underneath the Tibetan plateau caused the inverted metamorphic sequence in the Lesser Himalayan Sequence and in the Greater Himalayan Sequence. This process also led to occurrences of present-day surface rocks that were derived from variable distances down dip, but from similar crustal depths. Such an exhumation pattern can explain the similar peak pressures for the Greater Himalayan Sequence along the length of the Himalayas. \ss{} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The emphasis is put on the projection step, which enforces incompressibility. Three types of variational approximations are reviewed. In the first one, the projection step is solved as a div-grad problem with velocity test functions satisfying (at first glance) a paradoxical Dirichlet condition. In the second method, the projection step is still solved as a div-grad problem but the velocity test functions satisfy a boundary condition only for the normal component. In the third approach the projection step is solved in the form of a Poisson equation supplemented with a Neumann boundary condition. The first method is shown to be legitimate and economical for finite element approximations, whereas the second is shown to be useful for spectral approximations. The third one is probably the easiest to implement since it avoids the problem of the mass matrix occurring in the two others. Though the second and third approaches do not directly involve a inf-sup condition, this condition is pointed out to be necessary to establish convergence and rule out possible spurious pressure. Finally some links between these algorithms and some preconditioning techniques of the Uzawa operator are shown.},

  abstract = {A series of numerical issues related to the analysis and implementation of fractional step methods for incompressible flows are addressed in this paper. These methods are often referred to in the literature as projection methods, and can be classified into three classes, namely the pressure-correction methods, the velocity-correction methods, and the consistent splitting methods. For each class of schemes, theoretical and numerical convergence results available in the literature are reviewed and open questions are discussed. The essential results are summarized in a table which could serve as a useful reference to numerical analysts and practitioners.},

It is shown that the original Cauchy principal value integral can be transformed into an element-by-element sum of regular integrals, each one expressed in terms of intrinsic (local) coordinates. The actual computation can be performed by standard quadrature formulae and can be easily included in any existing computer code. The numerical results demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the method, along with its insensitivity to the mesh pattern. This new method has full generality and, therefore, can be applied in any field of applied mechanics. Moreover, there are no restrictions on the numerical implementation, as the singular integrals may be defined on surface elements or internal cells of any order and type.},

It is shown that boundary integral equations with hypersingular kernels are perfectly meaningful even at non-smooth boundary points, and that special interpretations of the integrals involved are not necessary. Careful analysis of the limiting process has also strong relevance for the development of an appropriate numerical algorithm. In the second part, a new general method for the evaluation of hypersingular surface integrals in the boundary element method (BEM) is presented. The proposed method can be systematically applied in any BEM analysis, either with open or closed surfaces, and with curved boundary elements of any kind and order (of course, provided the density function meets necessary regularity requirements at each collocation point). The algorithm operates in the parameter plane of intrinsic coordinates and allows any hypersingular integral in the BEM to be directly transformed into a sum of a double and a one-dimensional regular integrals. Since all singular integrations are performed analytically, standard quadrature formulae can be used. For the first time, numerical results are presented for hypersingular integrals on curved (distorted) elements for three-dimensional problems.},

  abstract = {Competing models have been proposed to account for the unusual uplift of the Longmen Shan fault zone in the eastern Tibetan Plateau and resulting hazards. However, due to the terrain and thick sedimentary cover, the crustal structure of the eastern Tibetan Plateau remains uncertain. Therefore, testing these models has been difficult. In 2011, a 310 km long, SE-trending SinoProbe-02 deep seismic reflection profile was recorded in easternmost Tibet in order to study its regional crustal structure. The resulting image revealed the detailed crustal structure of eastern Tibet, which when combined with geological, GPS (Global Positioning System), and geochemical evidence, strongly suggests that Yangtze sub-continent crust extends beneath the region. The seismic profile also images the tremendously thick Triassic sedimentary cover in the Songpan-Ganzi terrane (SGT). These Triassic sediments vary considerably in thickness across several crustal blocks. In addition, both the Longriba fault zone of the northeastern SGT and the Longmen Shan fault zone show strong intracrustal reflections that terminate at a depth coinciding largely with the crust\textendash mantle boundary (Moho). Accordingly, we propose a new tectonic model based on an integrated analysis of this seismic reflection profile and previous GPS measurements. In this model, crustal-scale deformation is suggested to have participated in the oblique extrusion and uplift of the easternmost edge of the Tibetan Plateau along the Longmen Shan. In a broader context, the lithospheric configuration imaged by the seismic reflection profile will advance our understanding of the tectonic response of the eastern Tibetan Plateau to the ongoing India\textendash Eurasia collision and has new implications for the estimating seismic risk in the region.},

RB-methods have so far mainly been applied to finite element schemes for elliptic and parabolic problems. In the current study we extend the methodology to general evolution schemes such as finite volume schemes for parabolic and hyperbolic evolution equations. The new theoretic contributions are the formulation of a reduced basis approximation scheme for general evolution problems and the derivation of rigorous aposteriori error estimates in various norms. Algorithmically, an offline/online decomposition of the scheme and the error estimators is realized. This is the basis for a rapid online computation in case of multiple-simulation requests. We introduce a new offline basis-generation algorithm based on our a posteriori error estimator which combines ideas from existing approaches. Numerical experiments for an instationary convection-diffusion problem demonstrate the efficient applicability of the approach.},

In general, the slip rate and hence the seismicity of a fault decreases during loading and increases during unloading. Here, we present several case studies to show that a postglacial slip rate increase occurred on faults worldwide in regions where ice caps and lakes decayed at the end of the last glaciation. Of note is that the postglacial amplification of seismicity was not restricted to the areas beneath the large Laurentide and Fennoscandian ice sheets but also occurred in regions affected by smaller ice caps or lakes, e.g. the Basin-and-Range Province. Our results do not only have important consequences for the interpretation of palaeoseismological records from faults in these regions but also for the evaluation of the future seismicity in regions currently affected by deglaciation like Greenland and Antarctica: shrinkage of the modern ice sheets owing to global warming may ultimately lead to an increase in earthquake frequency in these regions.},

Measured bare-bedrock erosion rates likely represent the rate at which the highest portions of this broad upland are being lowered. Fluvial incision rates measured in the region over similar time scales are {$\geq$}2 times faster, suggesting relief is increasing in this portion of the Appalachians. This observation of increasing relief is inconsistent with prior work suggesting that the central Appalachian landscape is in dynamic equilibrium or currently decreasing in relief. We hypothesize that late Cenozoic climate change has accelerated fluvial incision rates, creating a disequilibrium landscape with growing relief with hillslopes undergoing adjustment to increased fluvial incision rates.},

  abstract = {We collect precise leveling data observed in the period of 1970 to 2012 around the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, and process the data to acquire present day crustal vertical velocity field. Vertical rates of 9 GPS sites are employed as a priori constraints to define the reference frame. The velocity field shows that most of the regions in the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau are undergoing uplift. The Gongga Shan and West Qinling are uplifting at maximum rates of 5.8 {$\pm$} 1.0 mm/a and 6.0 {$\pm$} 1.3 mm/a, respectively. A 2-D buried dislocation model is used to infer normal or reverse dip-slip rates. The result indicates that the reverse slip rate along the Longmen Shan fault is 4.2 {$\pm$} 0.5 mm/a, followed by the Daliangshan and Longriba faults with the rates of 3.7 {$\pm$} 0.5 mm/a and 2.8 {$\pm$} 0.3 mm/a respectively. TheZemuhe and northern section of the Xiaojiang fault have the normal slip rates of 2.3 {$\pm$} 1.0 mm/a and 2.9 {$\pm$} 0.4 mm/a respectively. Combining vertical velocity field with GPS derived horizontal velocity field, we investigate the characteristics of crustal movement and dynamic mechanism. The 3D velocity field indicates that the Helan Shan is uplifting and the Yinchuan graben is subsiding. The 3D crustal movement of the Liupan Shan region is segmented, with the area in the vicinity of the northern Liupan Shan fault uplifting and the area in the vicinity of southern Liupan Shan fault subsiding respectively. The subsidence of the central and southern Sichuan\textendash Yunnan terrain is caused by the near east\textendash west extension. The budget of horizontal material influx suggests that movements of the upper and lower crust are rather different in most of the region, excessive material influx into the lower crust/upper mantle underneath most of the sub-blocks seems required to maintain the uplift rates inferred from leveling, providing evidence for the existence of lower crustal flow in this region.},

These are the adaptive cross approximation, the multipole method based on interpolation, and the wavelet Galerkin scheme. The surface representation by a piecewise smooth parameterization is in contrast to the common approximation of surfaces by panels. Nonetheless, parametric surface representations are easily accessible from Computer Aided Design (CAD) and are recently topic of the studies in isogeometric analysis. Especially, we can apply two-dimensional interpolation in the multipole method. A main feature of this approach is that the cluster bases and the respective moment matrices are independent of the geometry. This results in a superior compression of the far field compared to other cluster methods.},

  abstract = {Boundary Element Methods (BEMs) may be used to predict the scattering of sound by obstacles, which has accelerated the prototyping of new room acoustic treatments such as diffusers. Unlike the more popular frequency domain method, the time domain BEM is usually solved in an iterative manner which means it can exhibit instability, a crucial impediment to its widespread use. These instabilities are primarily associated with the resonance of cavities formed by closed surface sections, but may also be caused by discretisation or integration error corrupting physical damped resonances. Regular BEM implementations cannot model objects with thin sections due to a phenomenon known as Thin Shape Breakdown. This paper develops an algorithm which combines an accepted approach for modelling thin plates with the Combined Field Integral Equation which eradicates cavity resonances, thereby permitting models of mixed regular and thin bodies. Accuracy and stability are tested by comparison to verified frequency domain BEMs, examination of the transient response, and pole decomposition. This is done for a simple obstacle and a Schroeder diffuser, which comprises a series of wells separated by thin fins. The approach is successful but universal stability cannot be guaranteed for the diffuser. It is suggested that instability is caused by the lightly damped resonances of the wells being corrupted into divergent behaviour by numerical errors.},

Thermomechanical models for channel flow link such extrusion to focused orographic precipitation at the surface. Isotopic constraints on the timing of fault movement, anatexis and thermobarometric evolution of the exhumed garnet- to sillimanite-grade metasedimentary rocks support mid-crustal channel flow during the Early to Mid-Miocene. Exhumed metamorphic assemblages suggest that the dominant mechanism of the viscosity reduction that is a requirement for channel flow was melt weakening along the upper surface, defined by the South Tibetan Detachment System, and strain softening along the base, bounded by the Main Central Thrust. Neotectonic extrusion, bounded by brittle Quaternary faults south of the Main Central Thrust, is positively correlated with the spatial distribution of precipitation across a north\textendash south transect, suggesting climate\textendash tectonic linkage over a million-year time scale. A proposed orogen-wide eastward increase in extrusion rate over 20 Ma reflects current precipitation patterns but climate\textendash tectonic linkage over this time scale remains equivocal.},

The Appalachian Wilson cycle began by formation of a Neoproterozoic to early Paleozoic rifted margin and platform succession on the southeastern margin of Laurentia. Three orogenies ultimately produced the mountain chain: the Ordovician Taconic orogeny, which involved arc accretion; the Acadian\textendash Neoacadian orogeny, which involved north-to-south, transpressional, zippered, Late Devonian\textendash early Mississippian collision of the Carolina superterrane in the southern-central Appalachians and the Avalon-Gander superterrane in the New England Appalachians, and Silurian collision in the Maritime Appalachians and Newfoundland; and the Alleghanian orogeny, which involved late Mississippian to Permian collision of all previously formed Appalachian components with Gondwana to form supercontinent Pangea. The Alleghanian also involved zippered, north-to-south, transpressional, then head-on collision. All orogenies were diachronous. Similar time-correlative orogenies affected western and central Europe (Variscan events), eastern Europe and western Siberia (Uralian events), and southern Britain and Ireland; only the Caledonide (Grampian\textendash Finnmarkian; Caledonian\textendash Scandian) events affected the rest of Britain and the Scandinavian Caledonides. These different events, coupled with the irregular rifted margin of Laurentia, produced an orogen that contains numerous contrasts and nonthroughgoing elements, but it also contains elements, such as the platform margin and peri-Gondwanan elements, that are recognizable throughout the orogen.},

This postseismic to coseismic moment ratio is larger than typically observed in earthquakes that rupture through the seismogenic zone but is much smaller than was hypothesized from modeling repeating earthquakes. Our results are consistent with a simple, self-similar model of earthquakes.},

All require at most O(N log2 N ) operations where N is the number of sample points. We also address implementation considerations and give heuristics for allowing reliable and computationally efficient floating point implementations of slightly modified algorithms. These claims are supported by extensive numerical experiments from our implementation in C on DEC, HP and SGI platforms. These results indicate that variations of the algorithm are both reliable and efficient for a large range of useful problem sizes. Performance appears to be architecture-dependent.

Analysis of core from two holes drilled through the fault zone, combined with geologic mapping and detailed investigation from three outcrops, define the fault geometry and physical properties of the Chelungpu fault in its northern and southern regions. In the northern region the fault dips 45\cyrchar\CYRNJE\textendash 60\cyrchar\CYRNJE{} east, parallel to bedding in both the hanging wall and footwall, and consists of a narrow (1\textendash 20 cm) core of dark gray, sheared clay gouge. The gouge is located at the base of a 30- to 50-m zone of increased fracture density confined asymmetrically to the hanging wall. Microstructural analysis of the fault gouge indicates the presence of extremely narrow clay zones (50\textendash 300 lm thick) that are interpreted as the fault rupture surfaces. Few shear indicators are observed outside of the fault gouge, implying that slip was localized within the gouge zone. Slip localization along a bed-parallel surface resulted in a narrow gouge zone that produced less high-frequency ground motion and larger displacements (average 8 m) during the earthquake than in the southern region. Displacement in the southern region averaged only 2 m, but ground shaking consisted of large amounts of highfrequency ground motion. The fault in the southern region dips 20\cyrchar\CYRNJE\textendash 30\cyrchar\CYRNJE{} at the surface and consists of a wide (20\textendash 70 m thick) zone of sheared, foliated shale with numerous gouge zones.

  abstract = {Along the San Bernardino strand of the San Andreas fault (SAF) and across the eastern California shear zone (ECSZ), geologic slip rates differ from those inverted from geodetic measurements, which may partly be due to inaccurate fault connectivity within geodetic models. We employ three-dimensional models that are mechanically compatible with long-term plate motion to simulate both fault slip rates and interseismic surface deformation. We compare results from fault networks that follow mapped geologic traces and resemble those used in block model inversions, which connect the San Jacinto fault to the SAF near Cajon Pass and connect distinct faults within the ECSZ. The connection of the SAF with the San Jacinto fault decreases strike-slip rates along the SAF by up to 10\% and increases strike-slip rates along the San Jacinto fault by up to 16\%; however, slip rate changes are still within the large geologic ranges along the SAF. The insensitivity of interseismic surface velocities near Cajon Pass to fault connection suggests that inverse models may utilize both an incorrect fault geometry and slip rate and still provide an excellent fit to interseismic geodetic data. Similarly, connection of faults within the ECSZ produces 36\% greater cumulative strike-slip rates but less than 17\% increase in interseismic velocity. When using overconnected models to invert GPS for slip rates, the reduced off-fault deformation within the models can lead to overprediction of slip rates. While the nature of fault intersections at depth remains enigmatic, fault geometries should be chosen with caution in crustal deformation models.},

In this method, the problems are initially approximated with possible unknowns. Then a correction functional is constructed by a general Lagrange multiplier, which can be identified optimally via the variational theory. Being different from the other non-linear analytical methods, such as perturbation methods, this method does not depend on small parameters, such that it can find wide application in non-linear problems without linearization or small perturbations. Comparison with Adomian's decomposition method reveals that the approximate solutions obtained by the proposed method converge to its exact solution faster than those of Adomian's method. 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This sequence occurred under the Indian Ocean, {$\sim$}400 km offshore Sumatra. The events are extraordinary for their unprecedented rupture of multiple cross faults, deep slip, large strike-slip magnitude, and potential role in the formation of a discrete plate boundary between the Indian and Australian plates. The SuGAr recorded static displacements of up to {$\sim$}22 cm, along with time-varying arrivals from the complex faulting, which indicate that the majority of moment release was on young, WNW trending, right-lateral faults, counter to initial expectations that an old, lithospheric, NNE trending fracture zone played the primary role. The new faults are optimally oriented to accommodate the present-day stress field. Not only was the greatest moment released on the younger faults, but it was these that sustained very deep slip and high stress drop ({$>$}20 MPa). The rupture may have extended to depths of up to 60 km, suggesting that the oceanic lithosphere in the northern Wharton Basin may be cold and strong enough to sustain brittle failure at such depths. Alternatively, the rupture may have occurred with an alternative weakening mechanism, such as thermal runaway.},

We use explicit time stepping because of the high parallel scalability and also because the physical time scale of the simulation is in the range of the explicit time step restriction. In the explicit DGSEM framework, the efficiency of element-wise operations is highly improved compared to standard DG implementations. This improvement is due to collocated interpolation and integration points and tensor product nodal basis functions inside the hexahedron. In the first part of this paper, we describe the DGSEM scheme and derive the element-wise operators. We will conclude this part with accuracy and convergence analysis. The locality of the explicit DGSEM scheme is highly attractive for parallel computing, thus the second part is dedicated to a parallel performance analysis of the code. In the last part, we show the applicability of the scheme with a direct numerical simulation of a weak turbulent flow past a sphere at Reynolds number 1000.},

The formulation is general enough to be a starting point for an analytical study or for a numerical treatment. The theory can be developed either by utilizing Betti's law or the weighted sesidual method, or directly resorting to physical meaning, as in the potential theory. To show that the results of the derivations are consistent with one another, we also prove four lemmas of the properties of the kernel functions. The derivations are continued by applying two commutative operations, traction and trace, leading naturally to the concept of Hadamard principal value. Consequently, singularity, often present in problems involving geometry degeneracy, causes no particular difficulties. Finally, we employ two examples to demonstrate the usefulness of the resulting dual boundary integral equations in both analytical and numerical solution procedures.},

Suitable for a given problem, the inversion method allows the adequate application of these procedures. Therefore, in a big range of applications a high accuracy can be achieved with only a few function evaluations of the Laplace transform. The inversion method is implemented as a FORTRAN subroutine.},

The basin is sandwiched between two transpressional ranges, which occur at the termination zones of two regional-scale dextral strike-slip fault systems. The basin contains distinct Upper Mesozoic and Cenozoic stratigraphic sequences that are separated by an angular unconformity, which represents a regionally correlative peneplanation surface. Mesozoic strata are characterized by northwest and south{$\pm$}southeast-derived thick clast-supported conglomerates ( Jurassic) overlain by fine-grained lacustrine and alluvial deposits containing few fluvial channels (Cretaceous). Cenozoic deposits consist of dominantly alluvial fan and fluvial sediments shed from adjacent mountain ranges during the Oligocene{$\pm$}Holocene. The basin is still receiving sediment today, but is actively deforming and closing. Outwardly propagating thrust faults bound the ranges, whereas within the basin, active folding and thrusting occurs within two marginal deforming belts. Consequently, active fan deposition has shifted towards the basin centre with time, and previously deposited sediment has been uplifted, eroded and redeposited, leading to complex facies architecture. The geometry of folds and faults within the basin and the distribution of Mesozoic sediments suggest that the basin formed as a series of extensional half-grabens in the Jurassic{$\pm$}Cretaceous which have been transpressionally reactivated by normal fault inversion in the Tertiary. Other clastic basins in the region may therefore also be inherited Mesozoic depocentres. The Dzereg Basin is a world class laboratory for studying competing processes of uplift, deformation, erosion, sedimentation and depocentre migration in an actively forming intracontinental transpressional basin.},

The only conditions required for the existence of the traction-BIE and the related Somigliana stress identity are weak continuity of the in-plane derivatives of the surface displacements and of the surface tractions. It is shown that the Cauchy Principal Value (CPV) interpretations so commonly used in BIE developments are unnecessary. The formulation is established not only at a smooth boundary point, but also at a comer point. The extension of the non-singular formulation to discontinuous boundary tractions and tangential derivatives of the boundary displacements applicable to a generalized problem statement as well as the usual BEM implementations is also shown.

  abstract = {The fundamental geological structure, geodynamics, and rheology of the Tibetan Plateau have been debated for decades. Two end-member models have been proposed: (1) the deformation of Tibet is broadly distributed and associated with ductile flow in the mantle and middle or lower crust, (2) the Tibetan Plateau formed during interactions between rigid lithospheric blocks with localization of deformation along major faults. The nature and distribution of continental deformation are governed by the varying rheology of rocks and faults in the lithosphere. Insights into lithospheric rheology can be gained from observations of postseismic deformation, which represents the response of the Earth's interior to coseismic stress changes. Here we use up to 2 years of InSAR and GPS measurements to investigate postseismic displacements following the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake in eastern Tibet and probe the differences in rheological properties across the edge of the Plateau. We find that near-field displacements can be explained by shallow afterslip on the Beichuan Fault, which is anti-correlated with the coseismic slip distribution. Far-field displacements cannot be explained by a homogeneous rheology, but instead require a viscoelastic lower crust (from 45 to 60 km depth) beneath Tibet with an initial effective viscosity of 4.4 \texttimes{} 1017 Pa s and a long-term viscosity of 1018 Pa s, whereas the Sichuan Basin block has a high-viscosity upper mantle ({$>$}1020 Pa s) underlying an elastic 35-km-thick crust. The inferred strong contrast in lithospheric rheologies between the Tibetan Plateau and the Sichuan Basin is consistent with models of ductile lower crustal flow that predict maximum topographic gradients across the Plateau margins where viscosity differences are greatest.},

  abstract = {The 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake ruptured an imbricate thrust system in the Longmen Shan range, which forms the eastern boundary of the Tibetan Plateau. We use seismic reflection data and surface geology to construct geologic cross sections and a three-dimensional (3D) fault model in the range front. The rupture was complex, with slip on both the steeply dipping Beichuan fault and the more shallowly dipping Pengguan fault, which appear to merge at depth. In contrast, only the Beichuan fault ruptured in the north, with the transition near a lateral fault offset. Thus, the earthquake involved multiple thrust splays and breached a significant segment boundary. To investigate the tectonic setting of the earthquake, we extend our previous measurements of crustal shortening (Hubbard and Shaw, 2009) into the interior of the range and show that shortening correlates with topography. This suggests that upper-crustal shortening can produce the high topography of the Longmen Shan without calling on other uplift mechanisms. Based on this understanding, we model the thrust belt as a critical taper wedge, to assess what rock and fault strengths are required to explain the topographic slopes within the range front and basin. The low taper within the basin is consistent with a weak detachment ({$\delta$}f {$\approx$} 0:1), while a slightly stronger ({$\delta$}f {$\approx$} 0:3\textendash 0:4) detachment is necessary to explain the higher taper of the range front. This difference may relate to the localization of the detachment within a Triassic evaporite sequence within the basin, while the faults beneath the range front are rooted in Precambrian metasedimentary or igneous rocks. Critical taper theory implies that shortening in the range front where the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake occurred is many times greater than in the basin, consistent with our shortening measurements. We examine the implications of these findings for seismic hazard assessment in the region and in other active mountain belts around the world.},

A sparse approximate inverse is computed explicitly, and then applied as a preconditioner to an iterative method. The computation of the preconditioner is inherently parallel, and its application only requires a matrix-vector product. The sparsity pattern of the approximate inverse is not imposed a priori but captured automatically. This keeps the amount of work and the number of nonzero entries in the preconditioner to a minimum. Rigorous bounds on the clustering of the eigenvalues and the singular values are derived for the preconditioned system, and the proximity of the approximate to the true inverse is estimated. An extensive set of test problems from scienti c and industrial applications provides convincing evidence of the e ectiveness of this new approach.},

We relate these events to the relative northward drift of India over its own slab. Our mantle-flow model derived from seismic tomography shows that dynamic topography over the southward-folded Indian slab explains the modern location of the foreland depocenter. Back in time, our model suggests that the stretched Indian slab detached from the Indian plate during the indentation of the Eurasian plate, and remained stationary underneath the northward-drifting Indian continent. We model the associated southward migration of the dynamic deflection of the topography and show that subsidence has amounted to \textasciitilde 6000 m in the foreland basin since 15 Ma, while the dynamic surface uplift of the Himalaya amounted to \textasciitilde 1000 m during the early Miocene. While competing with other processes, transient dynamic topography may thus explain, to a large extent, both the uplift history of the Himalaya and subsidence of its foreland basin, and should not be ignored.},

  abstract = {Among optimal hierarchical algorithms for the computational solution of elliptic problems, the Fast Multipole Method (FMM) stands out for its adaptability to emerging architectures, having high arithmetic intensity, tunable accuracy, and relaxable global synchronization requirements. We demonstrate that, beyond its traditional use as a solver in problems for which explicit free-space kernel representations are available, the FMM has applicability as a preconditioner in finite domain elliptic boundary value problems, by equipping it with boundary integral capability for satisfying conditions at finite boundaries and by wrapping it in a Krylov method for extensibility to more general operators. Here, we do not discuss the well developed applications of FMM to implement matrix-vector multiplications within Krylov solvers of boundary element methods. Instead, we propose using FMM for the volume-to-volume contribution of inhomogeneous Poisson-like problems, where the boundary integral is a small part of the overall computation. Our method may be used to precondition sparse matrices arising from finite difference/element discretizations, and can handle a broader range of scientific applications. Compared with multigrid methods, it is capable of comparable algebraic convergence rates down to the truncation error of the discretized PDE, and it offers potentially superior multicore and distributed memory scalability properties on commodity architecture supercomputers. Compared with other methods exploiting the low rank character of off-diagonal blocks of the dense resolvent operator, FMM-preconditioned Krylov iteration may reduce the amount of communication because it is matrix-free and exploits the tree structure of FMM. We describe our tests in reproducible detail with freely available codes and outline directions for further extensibility.},

Using a compilation of focal mechanism data we investigate spatiotemporal changes of the stress field orientations and find distinct variations along individual fault segments. Whereas the regional stress field prior to the Izmit earthquake and following the 2-month aftershock sequence reflects a stable strike-slip regime, the early aftershock period is dominated by EW-extension below the Akyazi Basin. During the 2-month aftershock period we find significant changes from strike-slip to normal-faulting during the main shock following by a systematic backrotation to the pre-main shock stress regime. This backrotation commences first in the Akyazi Plain hosting a co-seismic slip deficit of {$\leq$}3 m and propagates then further to the east towards the Karadere and Du\textasciidieresis zce faults where the Du\textasciidieresis zce Mw 7.1 main shock nucleated 87 d later.

  abstract = {The northern boundary between the Nubian (West African) and Somalian (East African) plates is marked by the existence of the East African Rift, which is the locus of roughly east-west stretching due to the separation of these plates. South of ϳ20؇S, any expression of deformation or seismicity due to the relative motion of these two presumably distinct plates vanishes or is extremely subtle, although the boundary must continue until it intersects another plate boundary. Until recently, there were no observational limits on the location of that intersection, and the recent limits were very broad, being thousands of kilometers wide. Here, from an analysis of the locations of the old edge of magnetic anomaly 5 (which is over 11 Ma seafloor), we show that the main locus of deformation between Nubia and Somalia near the Southwest Indian Ridge over the past 11 m.y. can be no wider than a few hundred kilometers, from ϳ100 km west of the Du Toit Fracture Zone to ϳ50 km east of the Andrew Bain Fracture Zone complex. Deformation is most likely concentrated along a closely spaced set of several fracture zones known collectively as the Andrew Bain Fracture Zone complex, which is only ϳ100 km wide. The displacement along the Nubia-Somalia boundary over the past 11 m.y. is 23 km ؎ 6 km (95\% confidence limits), indicating a displacement rate of 2 mm/yr, much slower than typical rates of seafloor spreading and subduction, but comparable to that along the Owen fracture zone and Dalrymple trough, which separate the Arabian plate from the Indian plate, and along the Azores-Gibraltar line, which separates the Eurasian plate from the Nubian plate.},

The unified model adds actor creation and coordination to the AFM, while also enabling parallelization within actors.

  abstract = {The Adirondack Mountains constitute an anomalously large, domical uplift on the Appalachian foreland. The dome has a NNE--SSW axis about 190 km long, and an east--west dimension of about 140 km. It has a structural relief of at least 1600 m, and a local topographic relief of up to 1200 m. First-order leveling in 1955, and again in 1973 along a north--south line at the eastern margin of the Adirondack shows an uplift rate of 2.2 mm/yr at the latitude of the center of the dome and a subsidence rate of 2.8 mm/yr at the northern end of the line near the Canadian border. The net amount of arching along this releveled line is 9 cm + 2 cm (Isachsen, 1975). To test the idea that this arching represented an "edge effect" of contemporary doming of the Adirondacks as a whole, the National Geodetic Survey was encouraged to relevel a 1931 north--south line between Utica and Fort Covington (near the Canadian border) which crosses the center of the dome. The releveling showed that the mountain mass is undergoing contemporary domical uplift at a rate which reaches 3.7 mm/yr near the center of the dome (compare with 1 mm/yr for the Swiss Alps). Three other releveled lines in the area support this conclusion.},

  abstract = {In the last decades surface exposure dating using cosmogenic nuclides has emerged as a powerful tool in Quaternary geochronology and landscape evolution studies. Cosmogenic nuclides are produced in rocks and sediment due to reactions induced by cosmic rays. Landforms ranging in age from a few hundred years to tens of millions of years can be dated (depending on rock or landform weathering rates) by measuring nuclide concentrations. In this paper the history and theory of surface exposure dating are reviewed followed by an extensive outline of the fields of application of the method. Sampling strategies as well as information on individual nuclides are discussed in detail. The power of cosmogenic nuclide methods lies in the number of nuclides available (the radionuclides 10Be, 14C, 26Al, and 36Cl and the stable noble gases 3He and 21Ne), which allows almost every mineral and hence almost every lithology to be analyzed. As a result focus can shift to the geomorphic questions. It is important that obtained exposure ages are carefully scrutinized in the framework of detailed field studies, including local terrace or moraine stratigraphy and regional morphostratigraphic relationships; as well as in light of independent age constraints.},

  abstract = {Asia is the world's largest composite continent, comprising numerous old cratonic blocks and young mobile belts. During the Phanerozoic it was enlarged by successive accretion of dispersed Gondwana-derived terranes. The opening and closing of palaeo-oceans would have inevitably produced a certain amount of fresh mantle-derived juvenile crust. The Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB), otherwise known as the Altaid tectonic collage, is now celebrated for its accretionary tectonics and massive juvenile crustal production in the Phanerozoic. It is composed of a variety of tectonic units, including Precambrian microcontinental blocks, ancient island arcs, ocean island, accretionary complexes, ophiolites and passive continental margins. Yet, the most outstanding feature is the vast expanse of granitic intrusions and their volcanic equivalents. Since granitoids are generated in lower-to-middle crustal conditions, they are used to probe the nature of their crustal sources, and to evaluate the relative contribution of juvenile v. recycled crust in the orogenic belts. Using the Nd-Sr isotope tracer technique, the majority of granitoids from the CAOB can be shown to contain high proportions (60 to 100\%) of the mantle component in their generation. This implies an important crustal growth in continental scale during the period of 500-100 Ma. The evolution of the CAOB undoubtedly involved both lateral and vertical accretion of juvenile material. The lateral accretion implies stacking of arc complexes, accompanied by amalgamation of old microcontinental blocks. Parts of the accreted arc assemblages were later converted into granitoids via underplating of basaltic magmas. The emplacement of large volumes of post-accretionary alkaline and peralkaline granites was most likely achieved by vertical accretion through a series of processes, including underplating of basaltic magma, mixing of basaltic liquid with lower-crustal rocks, partial melting of the mixed lithologies leading to generation of granitic liquids, and followed by fractional crystallization. The recognition of vast juvenile terranes in the Canadian Cordillera, the western US, the Appalachians and the Central Asian Orogenic Belt has considerably changed our view on the growth rate of the continental crust in the Phanerozoic.},

In this paper a precorrected Fast Fourier Transform (pFFT) higher-order boundary element method (HOBEM) is proposed for reducing the computational time and computer memory by O(N). By using a free-surface Green function for infinite water-depth, the disadvantage of the Fast Multipole Boundary Element Method (FMBEM)\textemdash i.e. unable to solve infinite deep-water wave problems\textemdash can be overcome. Numerical results from the problems of wave interaction with single- and multi-bodies show that the present method evidently has more advantages in saving memory and computing time, especially for large-scale problems, than the traditional HOBEM. In addition, the optimal variable of pFFT mesh is recommended to minimize time cost.},

The resulting effects on global chemical cycles are not fully known. Here we show changes in the dissolved chemistry of the Min Jiang, a river in the Yangtze River (China) headwaters, following the A.D. 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake. Total solute fluxes transported by the Min Jiang increased after the earthquake, accompanied by an \textasciitilde 4\texttimes{} increase in Na*/Ca ratios (where Na* is Na+ corrected for atmospheric and evaporite contributions) and a 0.000644 {$\pm$} 0.000146 increase in 87Sr/86Sr isotopic ratios. These changes are consistent with enhanced contribution from silicate sources. We infer that the CO2 consumption rate via silicate-derived alkalinity increased 4.3 {$\pm$} 0.4 times. If similar changes are associated with other large earthquakes, enhanced solute export could directly link tectonic activity with weathering and alkalinity fluxes that supply nutrients to ecosystems, influence seawater chemistry evolution, and steer Earth's long-term carbon cycle and climate.},

  abstract = {The horseshoe prior is frequently employed in Bayesian analysis of high-dimensional models, and has been shown to achieve minimax optimal risk properties when the truth is sparse. While optimization-based algorithms for the extremely popular Lasso and elastic net procedures can scale to dimension in the hundreds of thousands, algorithms for the horseshoe that use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for computation are limited to problems an order of magnitude smaller. This is due to high computational cost per step and growth of the variance of time-averaging estimators as a function of dimension. We propose two new MCMC algorithms for computation in these models that have improved performance compared to existing alternatives. One of the algorithms also approximates an expensive matrix product to give orders of magnitude speedup in highdimensional applications. We prove that the exact algorithm is geometrically ergodic, and give guarantees for the accuracy of the approximate algorithm using perturbation theory. Versions of the approximation algorithm that gradually decrease the approximation error as the chain extends are shown to be exact. The scalability of the algorithm is illustrated in simulations with problem size as large as N `` 5, 000 observations and p `` 50, 000 predictors, and an application to a genome-wide association study with N `` 2, 267 and p `` 98, 385. The empirical results also show that the new algorithm yields estimates with lower mean squared error, intervals with better coverage, and elucidates features of the posterior that were often missed by previous algorithms in high dimensions, including bimodality of posterior marginals indicating uncertainty about which covariates belong in the model.},

Global catalog data containing 35 years of M {$\geq$} 5.5 earthquakes allow us to explore for periods of enhanced or suppressed seismic activity. We consider 113 M {$\geq$} 7.5 main shocks between 1977 and 2012 and focus on seismic activity on time scales from seconds to days following these main shocks. We search for evidence of dynamic triggering of large-magnitude events similar to the previously observed global increase during the first few days following the 2012 M8.6 Indian Ocean main shock. We restrict the analysis to regions of elevated strain during the passage of surface waves. Using a threshold of 0.1 microstrain (\textasciitilde 3 kPa) and a temporal window of {$\pm$}1 year, we stack daily seismicity rate curves using the exclusion-zone declustered M {$\geq$} 5.5 catalog events in order to resolve deviations from the background rate. Our results do not indicate a significant change in activity for at least 10 days when considering the collective set of 113 main shocks and subsets at M8.0 and M8.5 thresholds. The results also do not indicate immediate triggering of M {$\geq$} 5.5 events. We do find two instances of increased seismicity in the elevated strain region within 10 days. These increases are subsequent to two main shocks, the 1977 M8.3 and 2012 M8.6, both located in the Indian Ocean. We conclude that a global change in M {$\geq$} 5.5 earthquake rates following a transient stress from distant earthquakes is a rare occurrence.},

Their described impacts on the land and the river were so dramatic as to produce widespread modem disbelief. However, geological, geophysical, and historical research, carried out mostly in the past two decades, has verified much in the historical accounts. The sequence included at least six (possibly nine) events of estimated moment magnitude M . 7 and two of M {$\cong$} 8. The faulting was in the intruded crust of a failed intracontinental rift, beneath the saturated alluvium of the river valley, and its violent shaking resulted in massive and extensive liquefaction. The largest earthquakes ruptured at least six (and possibly more than seven) intersecting fault segments, one of which broke the surface as a thrust fault that disrupted the bed of the Mississippi River in at least 2 (and possibly four) places.},

  abstract = {A new method (the sinh\textendash sigmoidal method) is proposed for the numerical evaluation of both nearly weakly and nearly strongly singular integrals on triangular boundary elements. These integrals arise in the 3D boundary element method when the source point is very close to the element of integration. The new polar coordinate-based method introduces a sinh transformation in the radial direction and a sigmoidal transformation in the angular direction, before the application of Gaussian quadrature. It also uses approximately twice as many quadrature points in the angular direction as in the radial direction, in response to a finding that the evaluation of these types of integrals is particularly sensitive to the placement of the quadrature points in the angular direction. Comparisons with various other methods demonstrate its accuracy and competitiveness. A major advantage of the new method is its ease of implementation and applicability to a wide class of integrals.},

  abstract = {Slip inversions of geodetic data from several large (magnitude {$\sim$}7) strike-slip earthquakes point to coseismic slip deficit at shallow depths ({$<$}3\textendash 4 km), that is, coseismic slip appears to decrease towards the Earth surface. While the inferred slip distribution may be consistent with laboratory-derived rate and state friction laws suggesting that the uppermost brittle crust may be velocity strengthening, there remains a question of how the coseismic slip deficit is accommodated throughout the earthquake cycle. The consequence of velocity-strengthening fault friction at shallow depths is that the deficit of coseismic slip is relieved by post-seismic afterslip and interseismic creep. However, many seismic events with inferred shallow slip deficit were not associated with either resolvable shallow interseismic creep or robust shallow afterslip. Hence, the origin of shallow `slip deficit' remains uncertain. In this study, we investigate whether inelastic failure in the shallow crust due to dynamic earthquake rupture can explain the inferred deficit of shallow slip. Evidence for such failure is emerging from geologic, seismic and geodetic observations. We find that the amount of shallow slip deficit is proportional to the amount of inelastic deformation near the Earth surface. Such deformation occurs under a wide range of parameters that characterize rock strength in the upper crust. However, the largest magnitude of slip deficit in models accounting for off-fault yielding is 2\textendash 4 times smaller than that inferred from kinematic inversions of geodetic data. To explain this discrepancy, we further explore to what extent assumptions in the kinematic inversions may bias the inferred slip distributions. Inelastic deformation in the shallow crust reduces coseismic strain near the fault, introducing an additional `artificial' deficit of up to 10 per cent of the maximum slip in inversions of geodetic data that are based on purely elastic models. The largest magnitude of slip deficit in our models combined with the bias in inversions accounts for up to 25 per cent of shallow slip deficit, which is comparable, but still smaller than 30\textendash 60 per cent deficit inferred from kinematic inversions. We discuss potential mechanisms that may account for the remaining discrepancy between slip deficit predicted by elasto-plastic rupture models and that inferred from inversions of space geodetic data.},

The IMEX algorithms solve the non-stiff portions of the domain using explicit methods, and isolate and solve the more expensive stiff portions using an L-stable, stiffly-accurate explicit, singly diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta method (ESDIRK). Furthermore, we apply adaptive time-step controllers based on the embedded temporal error predictors. We demonstrate in a number of numerical test problems that IMEX methods in conjunction with efficient preconditioning become more efficient than explicit methods for systems exhibiting high levels of grid-induced stiffness.},

  abstract = {We present a new numerical approach to solve the elastic wave equation in heterogeneous media in the presence of externally given source terms with arbitrary high-order accuracy in space and time on unstructured triangular meshes. We combine a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with the ideas of the ADER time integration approach using Arbitrary high-order DERivatives. The time integration is performed via the so-called Cauchy-Kovalewski procedure using repeatedly the governing partial differential equation itself. In contrast to classical finite element methods we allow for discontinuities of the piecewise polynomial approximation of the solution at element interfaces. This way, we can use the well-established theory of fluxes across element interfaces based on the solution of Riemann problems as developed in the finite volume framework. In particular, we replace time derivatives in the Taylor expansion of the time integration procedure by space derivatives to obtain a numerical scheme of the same high order in space and time using only one single explicit step to evolve the solution from one time level to another. The method is specially suited for linear hyperbolic systems such as the heterogeneous elastic wave equations and allows an efficient implementation. We consider continuous sources in space and time and point sources characterized by a Delta distribution in space and some continuous source time function. Hereby, the method is able to deal with point sources at any position in the computational domain that does not necessarily need to coincide with a mesh point. Interpolation is automatically performed by evaluation of test functions at the source locations. The convergence analysis demonstrates that very high accuracy is retained even on strongly irregular meshes and by increasing the order of the ADER\textendash DG schemes computational time and storage space can be reduced remarkably. Applications of the proposed method to Lamb's Problem, a problem of strong material heterogeneities and to an example of global seismic wave propagation finally confirm its accuracy, robustness and high flexibility.},

  abstract = {Additive Runge\textendash Kutta (ARK) methods are investigated for application to the spatially discretized onedimensional convection\textendash diffusion\textendash reaction (CDR) equations. Accuracy, stability, conservation, and dense-output are first considered for the general case when N different Runge\textendash Kutta methods are grouped into a single composite method. Then, implicit\textendash explicit, (N = 2), additive Runge\textendash Kutta (ARK2) methods from third- to fifth-order are presented that allow for integration of stiff terms by an L-stable, stiffly-accurate explicit, singly diagonally implicit Runge\textendash Kutta (ESDIRK) method while the nonstiff terms are integrated with a traditional explicit Runge\textendash Kutta method (ERK). Coupling error terms of the partitioned method are of equal order to those of the elemental methods. Derived ARK2 methods have vanishing stability functions for very large values of the stiff scaled eigenvalue, z[I] \textrightarrow{} -{$\infty$}, and retain high stability efficiency in the absence of stiffness, z[I] \textrightarrow{} 0. Extrapolation-type stagevalue predictors are provided based on dense-output formulae. Optimized methods minimize both leading order ARK2 error terms and Butcher coefficient magnitudes as well as maximize conservation properties. Numerical tests of the new schemes on a CDR problem show negligible stiffness leakage and near classical order convergence rates. However, tests on three simple singular-perturbation problems reveal generally predictable order reduction. Error control is best managed with a PID-controller. While results for the fifth-order method are disappointing, both the new third- and fourth-order methods are at least as efficient as existing ARK2 methods.},

Many diverse multiphysics applications can be reduced, en route to their computational simulation, to a common algebraic coupling paradigm. Mathematical analysis of multiphysics coupling in this form is not always practical for realistic applications, but model problems representative of applications discussed herein can provide insight. A variety of software frameworks for multiphysics applications have been constructed and refined within disciplinary communities and executed on leading-edge computer systems. We examine several of these, expose some commonalities among them, and attempt to extrapolate best practices to future systems. From our study, we summarize challenges and forecast opportunities.},

In comparison to the equiangular scheme, the GL scheme has larger spatial dimensionality, defined as the number of the samples required for the exact computation of SHT. In this work, we propose an efficient GL sampling scheme with spatial dimensionality equal to that of equiangular scheme. We also propose optimisation of samples along longitude to further reduce the spatial dimensionality of equiangular, GL and efficient GL sampling schemes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the accuracy of the SHT is not affected with the proposed reduction in the spatial dimensionality.},

The formulae use the cosine change of variables and trigonometric polynomial interpolation at the practical abscissae. Fast three-term recurrence relations for evaluating the quadrature weights are derived. Numerical tests are carried out using the current formula. As applications, two simple crack problems are considered. One is a semi-in\"ynite plane containing an internal crack perpendicular to its boundary and the other is a centre cracked panel subjected to both normal and shear tractions. It is found that the present method generally gives superior results. Copyright ? 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Recent work on the hybridization of mixed methods, and in particular of the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, holds the promise of capitalizing on the three aforementioned properties; in particular, of generating a numerical scheme that is discontinuous in both the primary and flux variables, is locally conservative, and is computationally competitive with traditional continuous Galerkin (CG) approaches. In this paper we present both implementation and optimization strategies for the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method applied to two dimensional elliptic operators. We implement our HDG approach within a spectral/hp element framework so that comparisons can be done between HDG and the traditional CG approach.},

The practical application of these methods, however, requires the accurate evaluation of boundary integrals with singular, weakly singular or nearly singular kernels. Historically, these issues have been handled either by low-order product integration rules (computed semi-analytically), by singularity subtraction/cancellation, by kernel regularization and asymptotic analysis, or by the construction of special purpose ``generalized Gaussian quadrature'' rules. In this paper, we present a systematic, high-order approach that works for any singularity (including hypersingular kernels), based only on the assumption that the field induced by the integral operator is locally smooth when restricted to either the interior or the exterior. Discontinuities in the field across the boundary are permitted. The scheme, denoted QBX (quadrature by expansion), is easy to implement and compatible with fast hierarchical algorithms such as the fast multipole method. We include accuracy tests for a variety of integral operators in two dimensions on smooth and corner domains.},

Contrary to many finite-element implementations, ours is implemented successfully in single precision, maximizing the performance of current generation GPUs. We discuss the implementation and optimization of the code and compare it to an existing very optimized implementation in C language and MPI on a classical cluster of CPU nodes. We use mesh coloring to efficiently handle summation operations over degrees of freedom on an unstructured mesh, and non-blocking MPI messages in order to overlap the communications across the network and the data transfer to and from the device via PCIe with calculations on the GPU. We perform a number of numerical tests to validate the single-precision CUDA and MPI implementation and assess its accuracy.

One uses a weak formulation of the equations of motion, which are solved on a mesh of hexahedral elements that is adapted to the free surface and to the main internal discontinuities of the model. The wave\textcent eld on the elements is discretized using high-degree Lagrange interpolants, and integration over an element is accomplished based upon the Gauss\^Lobatto\^Legendre integration rule. This combination of discretization and integration results in a diagonal mass matrix, which greatly simpli\textcent es the algorithm. We illustrate the great potential of the method by comparing it to a discrete wavenumber/re\textsterling ectivity method for layer-cake models. Both body and surface waves are accurately represented, and the method can handle point force as well as moment tensor sources. For a model with very steep surface topography we successfully benchmark the method against an approximate boundary technique. For a homogeneous medium with strong attenuation we obtain excellent agreement with the analytical solution for a point force.},

We restrict our attention to two-dimensional antiplane problems involving deformation in only one direction. Jump conditions that relate tractions on the interface, or fault, to the relative sliding velocity across it are of a form closely related to those used in earthquake rupture models and other frictional sliding problems. By using summation-by-parts (SBP) finite difference operators and weak enforcement of boundary and interface conditions, a strictly stable method is developed. Furthermore, it is shown that unless the nonlinear interface conditions are formulated in terms of characteristic variables, as opposed to the physical variables in terms of which they are more naturally stated, the semi-discretized system of equations can become extremely stiff, preventing efficient solution using explicit time integrators.},

  abstract = {There is strong evidence that the 11 March 2011 Tohoku earthquake rupture reached the seafloor. This is surprising because the shallow portion of the plate interface in subduction zones is thought to be frictionally stable, leading to the widely held view that coseismic rupture would stop several tens of kilometers downdip of the seafloor. Various explanations have been proposed to reconcile this seeming inconsistency, including dynamic weakening (e.g., thermal pressurization) and extreme stress release around shallow subducted seamounts. We offer a simpler explanation supported by 2D dynamic rupture simulations of the Tohoku earthquake. Our models account for depth-dependent material properties and the complex geometry of the fault, seafloor, and material interfaces, based on seismic surveys of the Japan Trench. The fault obeys rate-and-state friction with standard logarithmic dependence of shear strength on slip velocity in steady state. In our preferred model, the uppermost section of the fault is velocity strengthening. Rupture nucleates on a deeper, velocity-weakening section. Waves released by deep slip reflect off the seafloor, transmitting large stress changes to the upper section of the fault driving the rupture through the velocitystrengthening region to the trench. We validate the model against seafloor deformation and 1-Hz Global Positioning System (GPS) data. The seafloor displacements constrain the seismogenic depth and overall amount of slip, particularly near the trench. Our simulations reproduce many features in the GPS data, thereby providing insight into the rupture process and seismic wave field. Sensitivity to parameters is explored through an extensive suite of simulations. Neither static seafloor deformation nor onshore 1-Hz GPS data can uniquely determine near-trench frictional properties due to trade-offs with average stress drop. While conducted specifically for the Japan Trench region, our simulations suggest that rupture to the trench in megathrust events is quite possible, even if velocity-strengthening properties extend tens of kilometers landward from the trench.},

Singular value decomposition, QR decomposition with column pivoting, rank revealing QR factorization (RRQR), Interpolative decomposition etc are classical deterministic algorithms for low rank approximation. But these techniques are very expensive (O(n3) operations are required for n \texttimes{} n matrices). There are several randomized algorithms available in the literature which are not so expensive as the classical techniques (but the complexity is not linear in n). So, it is very expensive to construct the low rank approximation of a matrix if the dimension of the matrix is very large. There are alternative techniques like Cross/Skeleton approximation which gives the low-rank approximation with linear complexity in n. In this article we review low rank approximation techniques briefly and give extensive references of many techniques.},

Its Neoproterozoic amalgamation history involves early ( 800 Ma) and late Baikalian (600\textendash{} 550 Ma) orogenic phases. Two palaeogeographic elements are identified in the early Baikalian stage \textemdash{} the Gargan microcontinent and the Dunzhugur oceanic arc. They are represented by the Gargan Glyba (Block) and the island-arc ophiolites overthrusting it. The Gargan Glyba is a two-layer platform comprising an Early Precambrian crystalline basement and a Neoproterozoic passive-margin sedimentary cover. The upper part comprises olistostromes deposited in a foreland basin during the early Baikalian orogeny. The Dunzhugur arc ophiolite form klippen fringing the Gargan Glyba, and show a comprehensive oceanic-arc ophiolite succession. The Dunzhugur arc faced the microcontinent, as shown by the occurrence of forearc complexes. The arc\textendash continent collision followed a pattern similar to Phanerozoic collisions. When the marginal basin lithosphere had been completely subducted, the microcontinental edge partially underthrust the arc, and the forearc ophiolite overrode it. Continued convergence caused a break of the arc lithosphere resulting in the uplift of the submerged microcontinental margin with the overthrust forearc ophiolites sliding into the foreland basin. Owing to the lithospheric break, a new subduction zone, inclined beneath the Gargan microcontinent, emerged. Initial melts of the newly-formed continental arc are represented by tonalites intruded into the Gargan microcontinent basement and its cover, and into the ophiolite nappe. The tonalite Rb\textendash{} Sr mineral isochron age is 812 9 18 Ma, which is similar to a U\textendash Pb zircon age of 785 911 Ma. A period of tonalite magmatism in Meso\textendash{} Cenozoic orogenic belts is recognized some 1\textendash 10 m.y. after the collision. Accordingly, the Dunzhugur island arc\textendash{} Gargan microcontinent collision is conventionally dated at around 800 Ma. It is highly probable that in the early Neoproterozoic, the Gargan continental block was part of the southern (in modern coordinates) margin of the Siberia craton. It is suggested that a chain of Precambrian massifs represents an elongate block separated from Siberia in the late Neoproterozoic. The Tuva-Mongolia Massif is situated in the northwest part of this chain. These events occurred on the NE Neoproterozoic margin of Rodinia, facing the World Ocean. \textcopyright{} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The composition, sequence, and facial features of these volcanics show their affinity to the active continental margin. This is confirmed by geochemical data evidencing the participation of the Early Precambrian continental crust in their formation. The U-Pb zircon dating (SHRIMP) of the Sarkhoi volcanics yielded the Neoproterozoic age of the ignimbrites (782 {$\pm$} 11 Ma, concordant cluster N = 8).

We prove that the path-connected sublevel set, i.e., valleys, of a neural network which is Clarke stationary with respect to the training loss with weight decay regularization contains a specific, simpler and more structured neural network, which we call its minimal representation. We provide an explicit construction of a continuous path between the neural network and its minimal counterpart. Importantly, we show that characterizing the optimality properties of a neural network can be reduced to characterizing those of its minimal representation. Thanks to the specific structure of minimal neural networks, we show that we can embed them into a convex optimization landscape. Leveraging convexity, we are able to (i) characterize the minimal size of the hidden layer so that the neural network optimization landscape has no spurious valleys and (ii) provide a polynomial-time algorithm for checking if a neural network is a global minimum of the training loss. Overall, we provide a rich framework for studying the landscape of the neural network training loss through our embedding to a convex optimization landscape.},

  abstract = {The complex geology of central Asia records significant Phanerozoic growth and deformation of continental lithosphere, yet many questions about the timing and mechanisms of these processes remain. The Gobi Altai of southwestern Mongolia preserves much of this history in exposed mountain ranges and sedimentary basins. The Shin Jinst area (near latitude 44 21' to 44\textdegree{} 32', longitude 99\textdegree 35' to 99\textdegree{} 25') contains important evidence of Paleozoic growth and accretion as well as subsequent Mesozoic and Cenozoic deformation. Detailed mapping and structural data, including data sets on folds and cross-cutting faults, point to repeated episodes of deformation and add to recent work that documents Triassic and Jurassic compression as well as Cenozoic tectonic activity in this region. New 40Ar/39Ar data are interpreted to record Permian to Jurassic convergent margin processes. In particular, these data, in combination with previous studies, suggest that southern Mongolia records protracted deformation throughout the Jurassic that likely resulted from compression associated with the subduction zone at the southern margin of Asia at that time.},

  abstract = {Deformation in the Earth displays many degrees of localization. The mechanics of faulting can be well represented by slip on a 2D surface discretized in piecewise linear boundary elements. Distributed anelastic deformation associated with fluid flow, magma transfer, or viscoelastic relaxation can be approximated by anelastic strain discretized in 3D volume elements. The stress, traction, and displacement kernels for these elements form the basis of forward and inverse modeling of Earth's deformation during the seismic cycle, volcanic unrest or hydrologic change. While there are a number of techniques for computing these kernels for 2D fault surfaces, the techniques for 3D strain volumes are less developed. To improve the models of Earth's deformation, we extend previous work to numerically calculate these kernels for 3D strain volumes in a heterogeneous half space. The model provides high-precision displacement and stress for all these cases in a self-consistent manner. We exploit the adaptive multi-grid elastic solver implemented in the software Gamra (Landry and Barbot, 2016) to compute the deformation induced by boundary and volume elements with high numerical efficency. We demonstrate the correctness of the method with analytic tests. We illustrate the performance by computing a large-scale model of postseismic deformation for the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha, Nepal earthquake with heterogeneous material properties. The open-source, freely available software can be useful for the calculation of elasto-static Green's functions for localized and distributed deformation in a heterogeneous Earth.},

However, this distorted mesh can be difficult to generate and update. We present a new numerical method, inspired by the Immersed Interface Method (Leveque and Li, 1994), for solving the elastostatic equations with embedded discontinuities. This method has been carefully designed so that it can be used on parallel machines on an adapted finite difference grid. We have implemented this method in Gamra, a new code for earth modeling.

This claim is especially true for the sparse versions of the BETI preconditioners resp. methods. Moreover, there is an unified framework for coupling, handling, and analyzing both methods. In particular, the FETI methods can benefit from preconditioning components constructed by boundary element techniques.

Here we mainly consider the single layer potential integral equation, resulting from the direct boundary integral formulation of the interior, or exterior Dirichlet boundary value problems for the Laplace equation in two, or three spatial dimensions, as the most interesting boundary integral equation. The standard collocation, or Galerkin boundary element discretizations lead to fully populated system matrices which require O(Nh2) of storage units and cause the same complexity for a single matrix-by-vector multiplication, where Nh denotes the number of boundary unknowns. Data-sparse matrix approximation schemes such as ACA reduce this complexity to an almost linear behavior in Nh. Since the single layer potential operator is a pseudo-differential operator of the order -1, the resulting boundary element matrices have large condition numbers on fine meshes. Iterative solvers dramatically suffer from this property for growing Nh. Our AMG-preconditioners avoid the increase of the iteration numbers and result in almost optimal solvers with respect to the total complexity. This behavior is confirmed by our numerical experiments. Let us mention that our AMG-preconditioners use only single grid information provided by the ACA system matrix and by the usual mesh data on the finest level anyway. Similar results are valid for the hypersingular integral operator that is easier to handle since it is a pseudo-differential operator of the order +1.},

  abstract = {We describe and present results from a finite-volume (FV) parallel computer code for forward modelling the Maxwell viscoelastic response of a 3-D, self-gravitating, elastically compressible Earth to an arbitrary surface load. We implement a conservative, control volume discretization of the governing equations using a tetrahedral grid in Cartesian geometry and a low-order, linear interpolation. The basic starting grid honours all major radial discontinuities in the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM), and the models are permitted arbitrary spatial variations in viscosity and elastic parameters. These variations may be either continuous or discontinuous at a set of grid nodes forming a 3-D surface within the (regional or global) modelling domain. In the second part of the paper, we adopt the FV methodology and a spherically symmetric Earth model to generate a suite of predictions sampling a broad class of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) data types (3-D crustal motions, long-wavelength gravity anomalies). These calculations, based on either a simple disc load history or a global Late Pleistocene ice load reconstruction (ICE-3G), are benchmarked against predictions generated using the traditional normal-mode approach to GIA. The detailed comparison provides a guide for future analyses (e.g. what grid resolution is required to obtain a specific accuracy?) and it indicates that discrepancies in predictions of 3-D crustal velocities less than 0.1 mm yr-1 are generally obtainable for global grids with {$\sim$}3 \texttimes{} 106 nodes; however, grids of higher resolution are required to predict large-amplitude ({$>$}1 cm yr-1) radial velocities in zones of peak postglacial uplift (e.g. James bay) to the same level of absolute accuracy. We conclude the paper with a first application of the new formulation to a 3-D problem. Specifically, we consider the impact of mantle viscosity heterogeneity on predictions of present-day 3-D crustal motions in North America. In these tests, the lateral viscosity variation is constructed, with suitable scaling, from tomographic images of seismic S-wave heterogeneity, and it is characterized by approximately 2 orders of magnitude (peak-to-peak) lateral variations within the lower mantle and 1 order of magnitude variations in the bulk of the upper mantle (below the asthenosphere). We find that the introduction of 3-D viscosity structure has a profound impact on horizontal velocities; indeed, the magnitude of the perturbation (of order 1 mm yr-1) is as large as the prediction generated from the underlying (1-D) radial reference model and it far exceeds observational uncertainties currently being obtained from space-geodetic surveying. The relative impact of lateral viscosity variations on predicted radial motions is significantly smaller.},

This longevity is promoted by the fact that continents are underlain by highly melt-depleted peridotites, which result in a chemically distinct boundary layer that is intrinsically buoyant and strong (owing to dehydration). This chemical boundary layer counteracts the destabilizing effect of the cold thermal state of continents. The compositions of cratonic peridotites require formation at shallower depths than they currently reside, suggesting that the building blocks of continents formed in oceanic or arc environments and became ``continental'' after significant thickening or underthrusting. Continents are difficult to destroy, but refertilization and rehydration of continental mantle by the passage of melts can nullify the unique stabilizing composition of continents.},

  abstract = {The Taiwan area, where the Philippine Sea Plate collides with Eurasia, is one of the most seismically active areas in the world and has been consequently struck repeatedly by destructive earthquakes. To better constrain the occurrence of large earthquakes, we have conducted two cruises in 2012 and 2013 from which five piston, gravity and box-cores were retrieved from selected sites in targeted areas that contain continuous and accurate turbidite deposition offshore eastern Taiwan. Forty-seven turbidite layers deposited between 675 BC and 2012 AD have been described in the cores with facies varying from silty clay to coarse sand. We modeled each turbidite layer using the sedimentation rate deduced from radiocarbon age measurements performed on planktonic foraminifers. Precise dating based on 210Pb\textendash 137Cs chronology provided ages for the XXth century turbidites. Coring sites' locations, biotic association within turbidites beds and seismic calibration over the instrumental period, suggest that earthquakes are the most likely triggering mechanisms of turbidity currents over the last 2700 years. Calibration of correlations between turbidites and instrumental earthquakes allowed us to determine the minimum magnitude of recorded events (Mw = 6.8) and the maximum distance between the epicenter and the slope failure. Turbidites' synchroneity between cores has been tested but results showed that this criterion cannot be used in our study area because of the high level of seismicity, i.e., a M N 6.8 earthquake recurrence interval much smaller than the uncertainty on radiocarbon ages. The excellent accuracy of dating allows correlating all the turbidites deposited since 1920 with instrumental earthquakes. For each core, we established a return time ranging between 112 and 147 years for the period pre-1900 and \textasciitilde{} 27 and 34 years for the period post1900. The discrepancy between pre-1900 and post-1900 recurrence either suggests, that slope stability varies, with higher slope instability after 1900 possibly due to increased sediment delivery by rivers.},

  abstract = {The Red River Fault zone (RRF) is the major geological discontinuity that separates South China from Indochina. Today it corresponds to a great right-lateral fault, following for over 900 km the edges of four narrow ( {$<$} 20 km wide) high-grade gneiss ranges that together form the Ailao Shan-Red River (ASRR) metamorphic belt: the Day Nui Con Voi in Vietnam, and the Ailao, Diancang and Xuelong Shan in Yunnan. The Ailao Shan, the longest of those ranges, is fringed to the south by a strip of low-grade schists that contain ultramafic bodies. The ASRR belt has thus commonly been viewed as a suture. A detailed study of the Ailao and Diancang Shan shows that the gneiss cores of the ranges are composed of strongly foliated and lineated mylonitic gneisses. The foliation is usually steep and the lineation nearly horizontal, both being almost parallel to the local trend of the gneissic cores. Numerous shear criteria, including asymmetric tails on porphyroclasts., C- S or C ' - S structures, rolling structures, asymmetric foliation boudinage and asymmetric quartz ( c ) axis fabrics, indicate that the gneisses have undergone intense, progressive left-lateral shear. P - T studies show that left-lateral strain occurred under amphibolite-facies conditions (3-7 kb and 550-780\textdegree C). In both ranges high-temperature shear was coeval with emplacement of leucocratic melts. Such deformed melts yield U / P b ages between 22.4 and 26.3 Ma in the Ailao Shan and between 22.4 and 24.2 Ma in the Diancang Shan, implying shear in the Lower Miocene. The mylonites in either range rapidly cooled to = 300\textdegree C between 22 and 17 Ma, before the end of left-lateral motion.},

  abstract = {A two-layer (crust and upper mantle), finite difference steady-state thermomechanical model of a long-lived (several million years) lithospheric strike-slip fault is presented, and its predictions compared with field observations from various major fault zones. In order to estimate the maximum amount of shear heating, all mechanical energy is assumed to be dissipated in heat, in ductile as well as in brittle layers. Deformation follows a friction law in the brittle layer(s), and a power-flow law in the ductile one(s). Variations of several independent parameters and their influence on the thermomechanical state of the fault zone and on shear heating are systematically explored. Shear heating is found to be more important in fault zones affecting an initially cold lithosphere, and increases with slip rate, friction coefficient and stiffness of materials. In extreme cases (slip rate of 10 cm yr-1, stiff lithosphere), shear heating could lead to temperature increases close to 590 \textdegree C at the Moho, and 475 \textdegree C at 20 km depth. For more common cases, shear heating leads to smaller temperature increases, but can still explain high-grade metamorphic conditions encountered in strike-slip shear zones. However, modelled temperature conditions often fall short of those observed. This could be due to heat transport by mechanisms more efficient than conduction. Common syntectonic emplacement of granitic melts in ductile strike-slip shear zones can be explained by lower crust partial melting induced by shear heating in the upper mantle. Besides slip rate, the possibility of such melting depends mostly on the upper mantle rheology and on the fertility of the lower crust: for hard upper mantle and highly fertile lower crust, partial melting could occur at rates of 1 cm yr-1, while in most cases it would result from the breakdown of micas for slip rates over 3 cm yr-1. As a result of shear heating, partial melting of the upper mantle could occur in the presence of small amounts of fluids. Rise of magmas and/or hot fluids in the shear zone will further enhance the temperature increase in shallower parts of the fault zone. In nature, shear heating would inevitably cause strain localization in the deeper parts of strike-slip faults, as is often observed in the field for crustal shear zones.},

This paper examines the overhead of a decentralized gossip algorithm on the performance of parallel MPI applications running on up to 8192 nodes of an IBM BlueGene/Q supercomputer. The applications that were used in the experiments include PTRANS and MPI-FFT from the HPCC benchmark suite as well as the coupled weather and cloud simulation model COSMOSPECS+FD4. In most cases, no gossip overhead was observed when the gossip messages were sent at intervals of 256 ms or more. As expected, the overhead that is observed at higher rates is sensitive to the communication pattern of the application and the amount of gossip information being circulated.},

Advances in monitoring techniques have made it possible to collect measurements at a high frequency while the plume moves, which has the potential advantage of providing continuous high-resolution images of fluid flow with the aid of data processing. However, the applicability of this approach is limited by the high computational cost associated with having to analyze large data sets within the time constraints imposed by real-time monitoring. Existing data assimilation methods have computational requirements that increase super-linearly with the size of the unknowns m. In this paper, we present the HiKF, a new Kalman filter (KF) variant powered by the hierarchical matrix approach that dramatically reduces the computational and storage cost of the standard KF from O(m2) to O(m), while producing practically the same results. The version of HiKF that is presented here takes advantage of the so-called random walk dynamical model, which is tailored to a class of data assimilation problems in which measurements are collected quasi-continuously. The proposed method has been applied to a realistic CO2 injection model and compared with the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). Numerical results show that HiKF can provide estimates that are more accurate than EnKF, and also demonstrate the usefulness of modeling the system dynamics as a random walk in this context.},

The co-seismic ruptures mainly occurred along the pre-existing Yingxiu\textendash Beichuan, Guanxian\textendash Anxian, and Qingchuan faults, which are the main faults of the Longmen Shan Thrust Belt. The displacements measured in the field are approximately 0.5\textendash 6.5 m in the vertical (typically 1\textendash 3 m), accompanied by an average left-lateral component of b 2 m along the 50-km-long southernmost segment of the rupture zone and an average right-lateral component of b 1 m along the 150-km-long central-northern segments. The maximum thrust slip amount is estimated to be \textasciitilde{} 10 m, accompanied by 9 m of shortening across the rupture zone; this finding is consistent with estimates based on seismic data. The rupture length and maximum vertical displacement are the largest among all intracontinental thrust-type earthquakes reported to date. Our findings demonstrate that i) the Wenchuan earthquake occurred upon pre-existing active faults of the Longmen Shan Thrust Belt, thereby controlling the spatial distribution of co-seismic surface rupture and displacement, and the rupture processes of the earthquake; ii) the long rupture length and large thrusting slip resulted from compressive stress associated with eastward extrusion of the Tibet Plateau as it accommodates the ongoing penetration of the Indian Plate into the Eurasian Plate; and iii) present-day shortening strain upon the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau is mostly released by seismic slip along thrust faults within the Longmen Shan Thrust Belt.},

This problem is addressed by the ALOS-2 satellite, whose PALSAR-2 instrument operates in ScanSAR mode, enabling a repeat time of 2 weeks and a swath width of 350 km. Here we present InSAR line-of-sight displacement data from ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 observations covering the Mw 7.8 Gorkha, Nepal earthquake and its Mw 7.3 aftershock that were acquired within 1 week of each event. The data are made freely available and we encourage their use in models of the fault slip and associated stress changes. The Mw 7.3 aftershock not only extended the rupture area of the main shock toward the east but also left a 20 km gap where the fault has little or no coseismic slip. We estimate this unslipped fault patch has the potential to generate a Mw 6.9 event.},

  abstract = {Collectively, machine learning (ML) researchers are engaged in the creation and dissemination of knowledge about data-driven algorithms. In a given paper, researchers might aspire to any subset of the following goals, among others: to theoretically characterize what is learnable, to obtain understanding through empirically rigorous experiments, or to build a working system that has high predictive accuracy. While determining which knowledge warrants inquiry may be subjective, once the topic is fixed, papers are most valuable to the community when they act in service of the reader, creating foundational knowledge and communicating as clearly as possible. Recent progress in machine learning comes despite frequent departures from these ideals. In this paper, we focus on the following four patterns that appear to us to be trending in ML scholarship: (i) failure to distinguish between explanation and speculation; (ii) failure to identify the sources of empirical gains, e.g., emphasizing unnecessary modifications to neural architectures when gains actually stem from hyper-parameter tuning; (iii) mathiness: the use of mathematics that obfuscates or impresses rather than clarifies, e.g., by confusing technical and non-technical concepts; and (iv) misuse of language, e.g., by choosing terms of art with colloquial connotations or by overloading established technical terms. While the causes behind these patterns are uncertain, possibilities include the rapid expansion of the community, the consequent thinness of the reviewer pool, and the often-misaligned incentives between scholarship and short-term measures of success (e.g., bibliometrics, attention, and entrepreneurial opportunity). While each pattern offers a corresponding remedy (don't do it), we also discuss some speculative suggestions for how the community might combat these trends.},

In the well-instrumented Cascadia margin, a class of Mw6.0 slow slip events arise beneath Port Angeles every {$\sim$}14 months, as inferred from two decades of continuous geodetic monitoring. The along-strike bending of the incoming oceanic plate beneath north Washington is a unique geometric feature whose influence on slow slip processes is still unknown. Here we incorporate a realistic fault geometry of northern Cascadia in the framework of rate- and state-dependent friction law, to simulate the spatiotemporal evolution of slow slip events on a nonplanar subduction fault. The modeled SSEs capture the major characteristics revealed by GPS observations. The central 150 km long fault segment beneath Port Angeles acts as a repetitive slip patch, where SSEs appear every {$\sim$}1.5 years with a maximum slip of {$\sim$}2.5 cm. Two minor slip patches with smaller areas and cumulative slips straddle this central slip patch. The along-strike segmentation of slow slip is inversely related to the local fault dip and strike angles of the slow slip zone, suggesting strong geometrical control on the slow slip process. This correlation holds even after removing the effect of W/h{${_\ast}$}, ratio between velocity-weakening SSE fault width and characteristic nucleation size. Besides the GPS-detectable fast-spreading phase, we find that each SSE cycle consists of deep pre-SSE preparation and post-SSE relaxation phases, which may be the driving mechanism for the deep tremor activity between major SSE episodes discovered in Cascadia.},

To improve our knowledge of pertinent mantle structures through tomographic imaging we combine P-wave arrival time data from temporary arrays in Tibet and stations of the Chinese Seismograph Network with reprocessed data from the International Seismological Centre. The new images reveal considerable spatial variations in mantle structure along the collision zone, and the horizontal distance over which presumed (continental) Indian lithosphere slides northward beneath the plateau decreases from west (where it underlies the Himalayas and the entire plateau) to east (where no indication is found for present-day underthrusting beyond the Himalayan Block and Indus\textendash Tsangpo suture). P-wavespeed appears low in the shallow mantle beneath much of central and eastern Tibet. These observations suggest that Indian lithosphere underlies only the southwestern part of the plateau and that the central and northeastern part is underlain by lithosphere of Asian origin. The (continental) parts of the Indian plate that currently underthrust or subduct below the plateau appear generally detached from the (oceanic) slab fragments that subducted longer ago and that have been detected deeper in the mantle, except perhaps in the central part of the collision zone (80\textendash 90\textdegree E). This suggests that ongoing India\textendash Eurasia collision must increasingly be driven by other forces, such as subduction of the Indian plate further west and east (e.g. beneath Indochina). Our images reveal structures associated with eastward subduction along the Burmese arc southeast of the eastern Himalayan syntaxis. The Tengchong volcanic complex in southwest China is marked by slow wave propagation to \textasciitilde 150 km depth, suggesting a causal link to subduction along the Burmese arc; the low velocities beneath the Red River fault region extend to greater depth and may be related to upper mantle processes further southeast.},

  abstract = {A symmetric Galerkin boundary element method is developed for the analysis of linearly elastic, isotropic three-dimensional solids containing fractures. The formulation is based upon a weak-form displacement integral equation and a weak-form traction integral equation recently developed by Li and Mear (1997). These integral equations are only weakly singular, and their validity requires only that the boundary displacement data be continuous, hence, allowing standard C'' elements to be employed. As part of the numerical implementation a special crack-tip element is developed which has a novel feature in that there exist degrees of freedom associated with the nodes at the crack front. As a result, a higher degree of approximation is achieved for the relevant displacement data on the crack and, further, the stress intensity factors are obtained directly in terms of the crack-front nodal data. Various examples are treated for cracks in unbounded domains and for cracks in finite domains (including both embedded and surface breaking cracks), and it is demonstrated that highly accurate results can be achieved using relatively coarse meshes.},

In this new formulation, the fundamental solution for 2-D elasticity is written in a complex form using the two complex potential functions in 2-D elasticity. In this way, the multipole and local expansions for 2-D elasticity BIE are directly linked to those for 2-D potential problems. Furthermore, their translations (moment to moment, moment to local, and local to local) turn out to be exactly the same as those in the 2-D potential case. This formulation is thus very compact and more efficient than other fast multipole approaches for 2-D elastostatic problems using Taylor series expansions of the fundamental solution in its original form. Several numerical examples are presented to study the accuracy and efficiency of the developed fast multipole BEM formulation and code. BEM models with more than one million equations have been solved successfully on a laptop computer.

  abstract = {A novel hybridization of the finite element (FE) and boundary integral methods is presented for an efficient and accurate numerical analysis of electromagnetic scattering and radiation problems. The proposed method derives an adaptive numerical absorbing boundary condition (ABC) for the finite element solution based on boundary integral equations. Unlike the standard finite element-boundary integral approach, the proposed method is free of interior resonance and produces a purely sparse system matrix, which can be solved very efficiently. Unlike the traditional finite element-absorbing boundary condition approach, the proposed method uses an arbitrarily shaped truncation boundary placed very close to the scatterer/radiator to minimize the computational domain; and more importantly, the method produces a solution that converges to the true solution of the problem. To demonstrate its great potential, the proposed method is implemented using higher order curvilinear vector elements. A mixed functional is designed to yield both electric and magnetic fields on an integration surface, without numerical differentiation, to be used in the calculation of the adaptive ABC. The required evaluation of boundary integrals is carried out using the multilevel fast multipole algorithm, which greatly reduces both the memory requirement and CPU time. The finite element equations are solved efficiently using the multifrontal algorithm. A mathematical analysis is conducted to study the convergence of the method. Finally, a number of numerical examples are given to illustrate its accuracy and efficiency.},

Then, new developments in Green's functions, symmetric Galerkin formulations, boundary meshfree methods, and variationally based BEM formulations are reviewed. Next, fast solution methods for efficiently solving the BEM systems of equations, namely, the fast multipole method, the pre-corrected fast Fourier transformation method, and the adaptive cross approximation method are presented. Emerging applications of the BEM in solving microelectromechanical systems, composites, functionally graded materials, fracture mechanics, acoustic, elastic and electromagnetic waves, time-domain problems, and coupled methods are reviewed. Finally, future directions of the BEM as envisioned by the authors for the next five to ten years are discussed. This paper is intended for students, researchers, and engineers who are new in BEM research and wish to have an overview of the field.

Seemingly pervasive ductile deformation within GH rocks and a lack of exposed hanging wall or footwall cutoffs for the MCT and STD have permitted models that predict 100's of km of coeval displacement on both structures, extruding the GH section via gravitational loading from Tibet and focused erosion along the Himalayan topographic front. We present new mapping, stratigraphic columns, mineral assemblages, U/Pb zircon ages, and a suite of structural data from GH and Tethyan Himalayan (TH) rocks in eastern and central Bhutan. Our observations highlight significant, {$\sim$} 250\textendash 300 \textdegree C along-strike changes in the deformation temperature conditions recorded by GH rocks. In eastern Bhutan, TH rocks are separated from GH rocks displaying ubiquitous partial melt textures by a top-to-the-north sense shear zone correlated with the STD. However, in central Bhutan, limited partial melt textures are only present near the base of the GH section, a biotite\textendash muscovite\textendash garnet mineral assemblage persists from 0.2 to 3 km above the MCT through TH rocks, and distinct lithologies interfinger at the GH\textendash TH contact, which suggests that TH strata are in depositional contact above GH strata. The same strata exposed on both sides of the STD limits slip along this structure to {$\sim$} 20 km. Thin-section scale top-to-the-south shear is focused in a 2\textendash 3 km-thick zone above the MCT while the overlying {$\sim$} 11 km-thick section displays top-to-the-north shear, suggesting asymmetric channel behavior. Strained quartz grains allow us to quantify {$\sim$} 23\textendash 34 km of top-to-the-north shear. Our data suggest that the GH\textendash TH section in central Bhutan acted as a cool, viscous, low-displacement channel, and when compared to sections in eastern Bhutan highlights dramatic changes in temperature conditions, viscosity and possibly displacement along strike. However, we suggest that the erosion rates needed to remove low-viscosity material limit channel flow even in regions containing significant partial melt, and that the magnitude of channel flow is small compared to the total mass balance of the system.},

  abstract = {The spatial complexity of continental deformation in the greater Tibetan Plateau region can be defined as the extent to which relative motion of the Indian and Asian plates is partitioned between localized slip on major faults and distributed deformation. Potency rates provide a quantitative metric for determining the magnitudes of diffuse and on-fault crustal deformation, which are proportional to strain rates within crustal micro-plates and fault slip rates, respectively. We simultaneously estimate micro-plate rotation rates, interseismic elastic strain accumulation, fault slip rates on major structures, and strain rates within 24 tectonic micro-plates inferred from active fault maps in the greater Tibetan Plateau region using quasi-static block models constrained by interseismic surface velocities at 731 GPS sites and 9 Holocene\textendash Late Quaternary geologic fault slip rates. The joint geodetic\textendash geologic inversion indicates that geologic slip rates are kinematically consistent with differential micro-plate motions. Estimated left-lateral slip rates on the Altyn Tagh, west-central Kunlun, and Xianshuihe faults are relatively homogeneous along strike (\textasciitilde 11.5, 10.5, and 11 mm/yr, respectively) while segmentation of the eastern Kunlun fault by the intersecting Elashan and Riyueshan faults results in a decreased slip rate, consistent with geologic observations. The fraction, {$\phi$}, of total potency rate associated with intrablock strain, uncorrected for observational noise, ranges from 0.27 in the Himalayan Range block to 0.91 in the Aksai Chin block. Monte Carlo simulations are used to quantify the likelihood that internal deformation is statistically distinguishable from the uncertainties in geodetic velocities. These simulations indicate that internal block deformation is statistically significant only within the Himalayan Range Front (where internal deformation accounts for {$\phi$}ID= 0.11 of block potency rate budget), west-central plateau ({$\phi$}ID= 0.68), Ganzi-Yushu/Xianshuihe (0.58), Burma (0.09), Jiali (0.38), and Aksai Chin (0.68) blocks. In the other 18 tectonic micro-plates within the plateau region, estimated internal block potency is not currently distinguishable from the expected contribution of observational noise to residual velocities. Of the total potency budget within the Tibetan Plateau, 85\% is taken up by slip on major faults, with the remaining 15\% accommodated by internal processes at sub-block scale distinguishable from observational noise. The localization of the majority of plate boundary activity is also supported by the spatial distribution of modern and historical crustal earthquakes. Sixty-seven percent of the total moment released by earthquakes in the CMT catalog and 90\% of historical moment since 1900 have been released within 25 km of the major faults included in the block model, representing only 12\% of the characteristic half-block length scale of \textasciitilde 215 km. The localization of deformation inferred from geologic, geodetic, and seismic observations suggests that forces applied to tectonic micro-plates drive fault system activity at the India\textendash Asia collision zone over decadal to Quaternary time scales.},

Microscopic examination reveals that the dark laminae are composed of micrite and contain a micrometer-scale, wavy fabric, whereas the light laminae are composed of relatively coarsecrystalline pseudospar that engulfs, surrounds, and crosscuts the dark laminae. Nearly all of the light laminae surround, or occur in proximity to, elongate (long axis fabric-parallel), spar-filled cavity structures. The average d18O values for dark and light laminae are 21.8\% (std. dev. 1.6) and 23.0\% (std. dev. 1.3) VPDB, respectively. Cavity-filling cements are even more depleted in 18O, with an average isotopic value of 26.2\% (std. dev. 1.1). These characteristics suggest that the coarsecrystalline, light laminae are the result of the preferential, aggrading neomorphism of a thinly laminated, micritic host rock and that the (now cemented) cavity structures acted as conduits for the fluid responsible for recrystallization. The oxygen isotope distributions are consistent with progressive recrystallization by an 18O-depleted fluid, likely of meteoric origin. Therefore, we interpret the prominent millimeter-scale, light\textendash dark layering in the lower Beck Spring Dolomite to result from widespread, laminae-parallel, diagenetic processes\textemdash perhaps controlled by fine-scale layer-parallel differences in initial porosity and permeability\textemdash and not from primary sedimentary processes.},

This is an effect that is corroborated by past dynamic modeling studies. However, field studies also show a great deal of complexity in fault-zone structure within a stepover, which is often simplified out of modeling studies. In the present study, we use the 3D finite-element method to investigate the effect of one type of smaller-scale complexity on the rupture process: a smaller fault segment positioned between the two primary strands of a strike-slip fault stepover. We find that such small faults can have a controlling effect on whether or not a rupture is able to jump the stepover and on the resulting ground motions from these ruptures. However, this effect is neither straightforward nor linear: the length of the intermediate segment and its basal depth, as well as whether the stepover is extensional or compressional, all contribute to the rupture behavior and ground-motion distribution. These results have important implications for assessing the probability of a rupture propagating through small- and large-scale discontinuities in faults, as well as for evaluating ground-motion intensities near fault stepovers. Because of the sensitivity of results to so many parameters, these results also suggest that modeling studies on idealized fault geometries may not be sufficient to describe the rupture behaviors of specific complex fault systems. Site-specific modeling studies, where possible, will provide better inputs and constraints for probabilistic rupture length assessments as well as for ground-motion estimates.},

  abstract = {Fast multipole methods have O(N ) complexity, are compute bound, and require very little synchronization, which makes them a favorable algorithm on next-generation supercomputers. Their most common application is to accelerate N -body problems, but they can also be used to solve boundary integral equations. When the particle distribution is irregular and the tree structure is adaptive, load-balancing becomes a non-trivial question. A common strategy for load-balancing FMMs is to use the work load from the previous step as weights to statically repartition the next step.

  abstract = {Fast multipole methods (FMMs) have O.N / complexity, are compute bound, and require very little synchronization, which makes them a favorable algorithm on next-generation supercomputers. Their most common application is to accelerate N -body problems, but they can also be used to solve boundary integral equations. When the particle distribution is irregular and the tree structure is adaptive, load balancing becomes a nontrivial question. A common strategy for load balancing FMMs is to use the work load from the previous step as weights to statically repartition the next step. The authors discuss in the paper another approach based on data-driven execution to efficiently tackle this challenging load balancing problem. The core idea consists of breaking the most time-consuming stages of the FMMs into smaller tasks. The algorithm can then be represented as a directed acyclic graph where nodes represent tasks and edges represent dependencies among them. The execution of the algorithm is performed by asynchronously scheduling the tasks using the queueing and runtime for kernels runtime environment, in a way such that data dependencies are not violated for numerical correctness purposes. This asynchronous scheduling results in an out-of-order execution.

The second period of events lasted from 0.82 Ga to 0.74 Ga and reflects a rifting process related to break-up of this supercontinent.

A new magnetostratigraphy of theTaxi He section on the north limb of theTugulu anticline in the middle deformed zone clari\textcent es the chronology of both tectonic deformation and depositional evolution of this collisional mountain belt. Our \$1200-m-thick section encompasses the upper Cenozoic terrigenous sequence within which \$300 sampling horizons yield an age span of \$8\^2 Ma. Although the basal age in theTaxi He section of the Xiyu conglomerate (often cited as an indicator of initial deformation) is \$2.1Ma, much earlier growth of theTugulu anticline is inferred from growth strata dated at \$6.0 Ma. Folding of Neogene strata and angular unconformities in anticlines in the more proximal and distal deformed zones indicate deformation during Miocene and Early Pleistocene times, respectively. In theTaxi He area, sediment-accumulation rates signi\textcent cantly accelerate at \$4 Ma, apparently in response to encroaching thrust loads.Together, growth strata, angular unconformities, and sedimentaccumulation rates document the northward migration of tectonic deformation into the northern Tian Shan foreland basin during the late Cenozoic. A progradational alluvial\^lacustrine system associated with this northward progression is subdivided into two facies associations at Tugulu: a shallow lacustrine environment before \$5.9 Ma and an alluvial fan environment subsequently.The lithofacies progradation encompasses the time-transgressive Xiyu conglomerate deposits, which should only be recognized as a lithostratigraphic unit. Along the length of the foreland, the locus of maximum shortening shifts between the medial and proximal zones of folding, whereas the total shortening across the foreland remains quite homogeneous along strike, suggesting spatially steady tectonic forcing since late Miocene times.},

In the case of piecewise smooth domains, these meshes are characterized by having large curved elements over smooth portions of the domain and geometrically graded curved elements to isolate the edge and vertex singularities that are of interest. This paper presents a procedure under development for the automatic generation of such meshes for general three-dimensional domains defined in solid modeling systems. Two key steps in the procedure are the determination of the singular model edges and vertices, and the creation of geometrically graded elements around those entities. The other key step is the use of general curved element mesh modification procedures to correct any invalid elements created by the curving of mesh entities on the model boundary, which is required to ensure a properly geometric approximation of the domain. Example meshes are included to demonstrate the features of the procedure.},

This is used in structural geology and geomechanics for the evaluation of the deformation and perturbed stress field associated with surfaces of displacement discontinuity. Such optimization significantly reduces (i) the time and memory needed for the resolution of the system of equations, but more importantly (ii) the time needed for the post-processing at observation points where the deformation and the perturbed stress field are evaluated. Specifically, it is shown that the H\`Amatrix structure used with the ACA, clearly captures the kernel smoothness during the postprocessing stage according to the field point positions, and optimizes the computation accordingly. Combined with the parallelization on multi-core processors, this technique allows intensive computations to be done on personal desktop and laptop computers. Numerical simulations are presented, showing the advantages of such optimizations compared to the standard method.},

The MSZ is about 200 km long curvilinear high strain zone trending WNW-ESE in its eastern part that splays out in the west. In Kantilo-Ganian segment of MSZ in northern EGMB, an interbanded sequence of granulite facies lithoassemblage has undergone ductile shearing. Kinematic studies of mylonite and ultramylonite indicate MSZ to be a NE-dipping, extensional type ductile shear zone. Non-coaxial metamorphic growth of garnet and presence of truncated sillimanite-fish in ultramylonite suggest high temperature regime during shearing. Pseudotachylytes in MSZ occur as millimetre thick layers to decimetre thick zones containing fragments of mylonite, ultramylonite and lithic clasts. Pseudotachylyte generation veins are mostly sub-parallel to C-planes and the injection veins cross-cut at high angle to these. The presence of an isotropic glassy matrix, injection features, corroded grains and dendritic microlites can be evidences for the existence of a melt phase. The composition of pseudotachylyte matrix (by EPMA) indicates silica deficiency with higher normative hypersthene, plagioclase and lower quartz compared with average whole rock composition for host. Absence of overprinting of mylonitic fabric on pseudotachylytes indicates their formation by brittle failure without passing through a plastic deformation and thus a two stage development for mylonite-ultramylonite and pseudotachylyte generation is suggested.},

In our PVFMM software library, we use kernel independent FMM and this allows us to compute potentials for a wide range of elliptic kernels. Our method is high order, adaptive and scalable. In this paper, we discuss several algorithmic improvements and performance optimizations including cache locality, vectorization, shared memory parallelism and use of coprocessors. Our distributed memory implementation uses space-filling curve for partitioning data and a hypercube communication scheme. We present convergence results for Laplace, Stokes and Helmholtz (low wavenumber) kernels for both particle and volume FMM.

  abstract = {The kd-tree is a popular and simple data structure for range searching and nearest neighbor searching. Such a tree subdivides space into rectangular cells through the recursive application of some splitting rule. The choice of splitting rule affects the shape of cells and the structure of the resulting tree. It has been shown that an important element in achieving efficient query times for approximate queries is that each cell should be fat, meaning that the ratio of its longest side to shortest side (its aspect ratio) should be bounded. Subdivisions with fat cells satisfy a property called the packing constraint, which bounds the number of disjoint cells of a given size that can overlap a ball of a given radius. We consider a splitting rule called the sliding-midpoint rule. It has been shown to provide efficient search times for approximate nearest neighbor and range searching, both in practice and in terms of expected case query time. However it has not been possible to prove results about this tree because it can produce cells of unbounded aspect ratio. We show that in spite of this, the sliding-midpoint rule generates subdivisions that satisfy the packing constraint, thus explaining their good performance.},

We here study at the worldwide scale how foreshock occurrence affects the postseismic phase and find a significant positive correlation between foreshock and aftershock activities: earthquakes preceded by accelerating seismicity rates produce 40\% more aftershocks on average, and the length of the aftershock zone after 20 days is 20\% larger. These observations cannot be reproduced by standard earthquake clustering models that predict the accelerating pattern of foreshock occurrence but not its impact on aftershock activity. This strongly suggests that slow deformation transients, possibly related to episodic creep, could initiate prior to the main shock and extend past the coseismic phase, resulting in compound ruptures that include a very long period (up to tens of days) component.},

We analyse the space\textendash time correlations of a worldwide seismicity data set (CNSS catalogue, 1963\textendash 1998, M {$\geq$} 5, depth {$\leq$}70 km), and show that seismic activity diffuses away from an earthquake as the time delay increases following its occurrence. Two regimes are observed: a slow diffusion at short timescales (up to 10 days) during which the mean distance R( t) between the initial earthquake and the subsequent earthquakes grows as R( t) {$\sim$} tH , with H = 0.19, and a second regime at longer timescales with H = 0.4. The growth exponent H in the first regime increases systematically with the size of the initial earthquake, but no such dependence is observed for the second regime. Associating the latter with the viscous diffusion of stress in the upper mantle, we obtain an estimate of about 1017 Pa s for the asthenospheric lateral viscosity. This diffusion indicates that the relaxation response of the crust to a stress step depends non-linearly, in respect of both its intensity and general form, on the perturbation. A positive correlation between the regional heat flow and diffusion exponent is found, suggesting a strong thermal control on the diffusion. The overall autodecorrelation and this diffusion process are the two major mechanisms by which seismicity systems relax stress concentrations, by redistributing them in space and in time. Both processes exhibit typical power-law behaviours, supporting the notion of space\textendash time scale invariance of stress exchanges between seismically active faults.},

K-FAC is based on an efficiently invertible approximation of a neural network's Fisher information matrix which is neither diagonal nor low-rank, and in some cases is completely non-sparse. It is derived by approximating various large blocks of the Fisher (corresponding to entire layers) as being the Kronecker product of two much smaller matrices. While only several times more expensive to compute than the plain stochastic gradient, the updates produced by K-FAC make much more progress optimizing the objective, which results in an algorithm that can be much faster than stochastic gradient descent with momentum in practice. And unlike some previously proposed approximate natural-gradient/Newton methods which use high-quality non-diagonal curvature matrices (such as Hessian-free optimization), K-FAC works very well in highly stochastic optimization regimes. This is because the cost of storing and inverting K-FAC's approximation to the curvature matrix does not depend on the amount of data used to estimate it, which is a feature typically associated only with diagonal or low-rank approximations to the curvature matrix.},

The time dependence of the problem is treated directly in the time domain (not in the Laplace domain) as a time evolution problem. The time derivative in the constitutive equation for a Maxwell viscoelastic body is approximated by the explicit Euler time-di\textexclamdown erencing scheme, which leads to time splitting of the stress tensor.

INLA is a deterministic paradigm for Bayesian inference in latent Gaussian models (LGMs) introduced in Rue et al. 27 . INLA relies on a combination of analytical approximations and efficient numerical integration schemes to achieve highly accurate deterministic approximations to posterior quantities of interest. The main benefit of using INLA instead of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for LGMs is computational; INLA is fast even for large, complex models. Moreover, being a deterministic algorithm, INLA does not suffer from slow convergence and poor mixing. INLA is implemented in the R package R-INLA, which represents a user-friendly and versatile tool for doing Bayesian inference. R-INLA returns posterior marginals for all model parameters and the corresponding posterior summary information. Model choice criteria as well as predictive diagnostics are directly available. Here, we outline the theory behind INLA, present the R-INLA package and describe new developments of combining INLA with MCMC for models that are not possible to fit with R-INLA.},

This paper describes an extension of such techniques to a wider class of matrices that are not themselves rank-deficient but have off-diagonal blocks that are; specifically, the class of so-called hierarchically semiseparable (HSS) matrices. HSS matrices arise frequently in numerical analysis and signal processing, particularly in the construction of fast methods for solving differential and integral equations numerically. The HSS structure admits algebraic operations (matrix-vector multiplications, matrix factorizations, matrix inversion, etc.) to be performed very rapidly, but only once the HSS representation of the matrix has been constructed. How to rapidly compute this representation in the first place is much less well understood. The present paper demonstrates that if an N \texttimes{} N matrix can be applied to a vector in O(N ) time, and if individual entries of the matrix can be computed rapidly, then provided that an HSS representation of the matrix exists, it can be constructed in O(N k2) operations, where k is an upper bound for the numerical rank of the off-diagonal blocks. The point is that when legacy codes (based on, e.g., the fast multipole method) can be used for the fast matrix-vector multiply, the proposed algorithm can be used to obtain the HSS representation of the matrix, and then wellestablished techniques for HSS matrices can be used to invert or factor the matrix.},

  abstract = {The concept of Pacific-type orogeny is revised, based on an assessment of geologic data collected from the Japanese Islands during the past 25 years. The formation of a passive continental margin after the birth of the Pacific Ocean at 600 Ma was followed by the initiation of oceanic plate subduction at 450 Ma. Since then, four episodes of Pacific-type orogeny have occurred to create an orogenic belt 400 km wide that gradually grew both oceanward and downward. The orogenic belt consists mainly of an accretionary complex tectonically interlayered with thin ({$<$}2 km thick), subhorizontal, high-P/T regional metamorphic belts. Both the accretionary complex and the high-P/T rocks were intruded by granitoids -100 million years after the formation of the accretionary complex. The intrusion of calc-alkaline (CA) plutons was synchronous with the exhumation of high-P/T schist belts. Ages from microfossils and K-Ar analysis suggest that the orogenic climax happened a t a time of mid-oceanic ridge subduction. The orogenic climax was characterized by the formation of major subhorizontal orogenic structures, the exhumation of high-P/T schist belts by wedge extrusion and subsequent domed uplift, and the intrusion-extrusion of CA magma dominantly produced by slab melting. The orogenic climax ended soon after ridge subduction, and thereafter a new Pacific-type orogeny began. A single Pacific-type orogenic cycle may correspond to the interaction of the Asian continental margin with one major Pacific oceanic plate. Ophiolites in Japan occur as accreted material and are not of island-arc but of plume origin. They presumably formed after the birth of the southern Pacific superplume a t 600 Ma, and did not modify the cordilleran-type orogeny in a major way. Microplates, fore-arc slivers, intra-oceanic arc collisions and the opening of back-arc basins clearly contributed to cordilleran orogenesis. However, they were of secondary importance and served only to modify pre-existing major orogenic components. The most important cause of cordilleran-type orogeny is the subduction of a mid-oceanic ridge, by which the volume of continental crust increases through the transfer of granitic melt from the subducting oceanic crust to an orogenic welt. Accretionary complexes are composed mainly of recycled granitic sediments with minor amounts of oceanic material, which indicate that the accretion of oceanic material, including huge oceanic plateaus, was not significant for orogenic growth. Instead, the formation and intrusion of granitoids are the keys to continental growth, which is the most important process in Pacific-type orogeny. Collision-type orogeny does not increase the volume of continental crust. The name `Miyashiro-type orogeny' is proposed for this revised concept of Pacific-type or cordilleran-type orogeny, in order to commemorate Professor A. Miyashiro's many contributions to a better understanding of orogenesis.},

The Baikal rift depression, located in southeastern Siberia, is one of the best investigated intra-continental rift structures in the world. In addition to being the site of comprehensive studies by Russian geo-scientists for decades, the Baikal depression is now the subject of new international investigations using advanced technical means and technologies. The present paper summarizes the principal results concerning the morphostructure of the Baikal rift, the stratigraphy of the Cenozoic deposits and the stages of the Baikal depression development. Based on cross-sections which exhibit the impact of both tectonic and climatic processes, the development of the Baikal depression occurred through two stages: (i) the pre(crypto)-rift stage of the Late Cretaceous-Eocene and (ii) active rifting of the Oligocene-Recent. The second stage is divided into several steps and substeps separated by tectonic phases. Formation of the Baikal rift zone appears to be related to the Indo-Eurasian plate collision related to a model of passive rifting. The uplifted shoulders of the depression have a complex morphostructure overlain by Cenozoic deposits which are thin and restricted in area. The near-marginal zones of the rift are largely defined by the system of longitudinal blocks of different width. Surfaces of the blocks are inclined either to the uplifted shoulder of the rift bound by listric faults typical for western edges of the depression or to the axis of the depression. Cenozoic deposits on the blocks consist of accumulative plains composed primarily of thick lacustrine sequences.},

  abstract = {A kinematic model for the earthquake cycle at convergent plate boundaries has been constructed on the basis of dislocation theory. We model the lithosphere-asthenosphere system by a stratified semi-infinite medium under gravity, consisting of an elastic surface layer, an intervening layer with Maxwell viscoelasticity, and an elastic substratum. The steady motion of plate convergence is naturally represented by uniform slip at a constant rate on the upper boundary of the descending oceanic plate. The occurrence of interplate earthquakes is regarded as a perturbation of the steady state plate motion, and represented by a periodic sequence of step slips on a finite seismic zone of the plate interface. Based on dislocation theory we can show that the steady slip on the interface deeper than the lithosphereasthenosphere boundary does not contribute to surface deformation in the steady state. Accordingly the surface deformation associated with the earthquake cycle is given by the superposition of viscoelastic responses to the steady slip on the interface shallower than the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary, the steady backslip on the seismic zone, and the periodic sequence of seismic slips. We have computed cyclic patterns of vertical displacements at the free surface for two representative cases, taking account of gravity effects. The patterns of vertical displacements differ notably in the latter stage of the cycle depending on whether or not the seismic zone extends through the entire thickness of the lithosphere. After the completion of one earthquake cycle, our model yields a certain amount of permanent deformation resulting from the steady plate convergence. The pattern of the permanent deformation, that is characterized by steep uplift on the continental side, sharp subsidence at the plate boundary, and gentle uplift on the oceanic side, is irrespective of the cyclic process of stress accumulation and release repeated on the seismic zone. The earthquake cycle model developed here provides a possible explanation for the formation of earthquake-origin marine terraces.},

The main idea is to use the integral equation formulation to define a discontinuous extension of the solution to the rest of the rectangular region.

New structural mapping and (U-Th)/He apatite and zircon thermochronology in this region further document the significance of Pleistocene N-S extension in this sector of the Himalaya. Patterns of (U-Th)/He accessory-mineral ages are not disrupted across the reactivated segment of the STFS basal detachment, indicating that Pleistocene offset was limited. In contrast, the trace of a N-dipping, low-angle detachment in the hanging wall of the reactivated Annapurna Detachment\textemdash formerly linked to the STFS, but here named the Dhaulagiri Detachment\textemdash coincides with an abrupt break in the cooling-age pattern in two different drainages {$\sim$}20 km apart, juxtaposing Miocene hanging-wall dates against Pleistocene footwall dates. Our observations, combined with previous fission-track data from the region, provide direct evidence for significant N-S extension in the central Himalaya as recently as the Pleistocene.},

In relation to anthropogenic climate change, modelling studies and projection of current trends point towards increased risk in relation to a spectrum of geological and geomorphological hazards in a warmer world, while observations suggest that the ongoing rise in global average temperatures may already be eliciting a hazardous response from the geosphere. Here, the potential influences of anthropogenic warming are reviewed in relation to an array of geological and geomorphological hazards across a range of environmental settings. A programme of focused research is advocated in order to: (i) understand better those mechanisms by which contemporary climate change may drive hazardous geological and geomorphological activity; (ii) delineate those parts of the world that are most susceptible; and (iii) provide a more robust appreciation of potential impacts for society and infrastructure.},

Although the Zagros deformation front is a relatively rectilinear feature, the sinuous map-view morphology of the mountain front is a result of a 6 km structural step in the regional elevation of the Asmari Limestone that produces a pronounced step in topography termed the `mountain front flexure'. Although the height of the mountain front flexure is sufficient to permit basement fault \textendash bend folds at the front of the Lorestan and Fars regions, the taper of the orogen, low percentage of shortening, and consistent structural elevation from the mountain front flexure to the hinterland suggest that Lorestan and Fars segments of the fold and thrust belt are completely detached on lower Cambrian salt and that basement-involved thrusting occurs only in the hinterland of the orogen. Mass balance constraints necessitate that detachment folds throughout the fold\textendash{} thrust belt are cored by faults that branch from the basal detachment. The steep dips of these faults and their depth within the lower Paleozoic sedimentary rocks can account for recorded earthquakes. This suggests that the , 11 \^ 4-km-deep earthquakes throughout the fold\textendash{} thrust belt may be nucleating within sedimentary rocks rather than in the basement as previously proposed.

Isostatic calculations, however, illuminate the difficulty in maintaining a 45-km-thick crust at or near sea level. We propose that an isostatically balanced, 30-km-thick, proto\textendash Colorado Plateau crust was thickened during the Late Cretaceous to early Tertiary by intracrustal flow out of an overthickened Sevier orogenic hinterland. This plateau would have been supported by a thick ({$>$}70 km) crustal root, which is proposed to have been the source region for hot and weak mid-crustal material that flowed eastward from the plateau toward the low-elevation proto\textendash Colorado Plateau.},

  abstract = {We link exhumational variability in space and time to the evolving geometry of the Himalayan fold\textendash thrust belt in western Bhutan. By combining new and published geochronologic and thermochronologic data we document the burial age, peak temperatures and complete cooling history from 20 Ma to the present over an across-strike distance of {$\sim$}125 km. These integrated cooling curves highlight windows of fast exhumation that vary spatially and temporally. We propose that pulses of fast exhumation are a result of structures that facilitate the vertical motion of material, illustrated in sequentially-restored cross sections. Due to a range of permissible geometries at depth, we explore and evaluate the impact of geometry on kinematics and rates of deformation. The linked cooling history and cross sections provide estimates of both magnitude and timing of thrust sheet displacement and highlight temporal variability in potential shortening rates. Structural and chronologic data illustrate a general north to south progression of Himalayan deformation, with emplacement of the Main Central thrust (MCT), Paro thrust and Shumar thrust by 12 to no later than 9 Ma. Two different geometries and kinematic scenarios for the Lesser Himalayan duplex are proposed. A north to south propagating duplex system requires that the southern portion of that system, south of the MCT, deformed and cooled by 9 Ma, leaving only the southernmost thrust sheets, including the Main Boundary and Main Frontal thrusts, to deform between 9 and 0 Ma. This limited post 9 Ma shortening would necessitate a marked slowdown in convergence accommodated on the Main Himalayan thrust. A two-tiered duplex system, which allows for the Paro window duplex and the southern Baxa duplex to form simultaneously, permits duplex formation and accompanying exhumation until 6 Ma. Limited cooling from {$\sim$}200 {$\smwhtcircle$}C to the surface post 6 Ma suggests either a decrease in shortening rates from 6 to 0 Ma or that duplex formation and exhumation are temporally decoupled. Our combined cooling curves highlight that the youngest cooling ages may not mark the fastest thrusting rates or the window of fastest exhumation. Instead, temporal variations in exhumation are best viewed through identifying transients in exhumation rate. We suggest that the strongest control on exhumation magnitude and variability is fold\textendash thrust belt geometry, particularly the locations and magnitudes of footwall ramps, which can change over 10's of km distance. Balanced cross sections predict the location and magnitude of these ramps and how they vary in space and time, providing an untapped potential for testing permissible cross-section geometries and kinematics against measured cooling histories.},

The resulting excess mass of the Andes gives rise to frictional stresses on the seismogenic plate interface that resist the sinking of the subducting slab into the upper mantle. Thus, subduction rates should be sensitive to the time-dependent dynamics of a back-arc orogen, as well as erosional or accretional processes that affect orogen growth. Here we develop a two-dimensional coupled orogen\textendash slab model that allows for the prediction of orogen size and plate motion in response to both tectonic and erosional forcing. We find that the frictional force exerted by the orogen on the subducting slab grows quadratically with orogen width and that the frictional resistance typically balances 10\textendash 50\% of the slab pull force. The time evolution of the coupled orogen-subduction zone system is largely controlled by the rate of orogen growth, which is controlled by the rate of convergence and the erosivity of the climate state. In the case of the Andean margin, our models show that Miocene aridification leads to reduced erosion, increased orogen growth, greater frictional resistance to subduction, and, ultimately, to a \textasciitilde{} 50\% reduction in the convergence rate between the Nazca and South American plates.},

The trench is due to a zone of extensional flow (associated with low pressure) in the upper part of the viscous lithosphere.},

We show that the modification induced by this splitting can be contained in the load vector, so that the stiffness matrix is not altered. The number of degrees of freedom is not increased by splitting. This method can be implemented entirely on the local element level, and we show rigorously that no net forces or moments are induced on the finite element grid when isoparametric elements are used. This method is thus of great utility in many geological and engineering applications.},

Late Middle to early Late Jurassic crustal shortening is widely thought to have resulted from collision of an amalgamated North China \textendash{} Mongolia block and the Siberian plate, but widespread late Late Jurassic \textendash{} Early Cretaceous extension has not been satisfactorily explained by existing models. Some prominent features of the extensional tectonics of the northern China \textendash{} Mongolia tract are: (1) Late Jurassic voluminous volcanism prior to Early Cretaceous large-magnitude rapid extension; (2) overlapping in time of contractional deformation in the Yinshan \textendash{} Yanshan belt with development of extensionrelated basins in the interior of the northern China \textendash{} Mongolia tract; and (3) widespread occurrence of alkali granitic plutonism, extensional basins and metamorphic core complexes in the Early Cretaceous. A new explanation is advanced in this study for this sequence of events. The collision of amalgamated North China \textendash{} Mongolia with Siberia led to crustal overthickening of the northern China \textendash{} Mongolia tract and formation of a high-standing plateau. Subsequent breakoff at depth of the north-dipping Mongol \textendash{} Okhotsk oceanic slab is suggested as the main trigger for late Mesozoic lithospheric extension of that tract. Slab breakoff resulted in mantle lithospheric stretching of the adjacent northern China \textendash{} Mongolia tract with subsequent ascent of hot asthenosphere and magmatic underplating at the base of the crust. Collectively, these phenomena triggered gravitational collapse of the previously thickened crust, leading to late Late Jurassic \textendash{} Early Cretaceous crustal extension, and importantly, coeval contraction along the southern margin of the plateau in the Yinshan \textendash{} Yanshan belt. The proposed model provides a framework for interpreting the spatial and temporal relationships of distinct processes and reconciling some seemingly contradictory phenomena, such as the synchronous extension of northerly terranes during major contraction in the neighboring Yanshan \textendash{} Yinshan belt.},

The method has been extended to oscillatory kernels (e.g., Helmholtz kernel) in [12]. Beside its generality this FMM turns out to be favorable due to its easy implementation and its high performance based on intensive use of highly optimized BLAS libraries. However, one of its bottlenecks is the precomputation of the multiple-to-local (M2L) operator, and its higher number of floating point operations (flops) compared to other FMM formulations. Here, we present several optimizations for that operator, which is known to be the costliest FMM operator. The most efficient ones do not only reduce the precomputation time by a factor up to 340 but they also speed up the matrix-vector product. We conclude with comparisons and numerical validations of all presented optimizations.},

We found that coseismic displacements accumulated during the last two decades can be larger than 10 m locally and that the cumulative displacement is not only due to large earthquakes but also to the accumulation of many small motions induced by smaller earthquakes. Then, investigating a global network of GPS stations, we demonstrate that a systematic global modeling of coseismic deformations helps greatly to detect discontinuities in GPS coordinate time series, which are still today one of the major sources of error in terrestrial reference frame construction (e.g., the International Terrestrial Reference Frame). We show that numerous discontinuities induced by earthquakes are too small to be visually detected because of seasonal variations and GPS noise that disturb their identification. However, not taking these discontinuities into account has a large impact on the station velocity estimation, considering today's precision requirements. Finally, six groups of earthquake scaling laws were tested. Comparisons with our GPS time series analysis on dedicated earthquakes give insights on the consistency of these scaling laws with geodetic observations and Okada coseismic approach.},

  abstract = {Coseismic surface deformation in large earthquakes is typically measured using field mapping and with a range of geodetic methods (e.g., InSAR, lidar differencing, and GPS). Current methods, however, either fail to capture patterns of near-field coseismic surface deformation or lack preevent data. Consequently, the characteristics of off-fault deformation and the parameters that control it remain poorly understood. We develop a standardized method to fully measure the surface, near-field, coseismic deformation patterns at high resolution using the COSI-Corr program by correlating pairs of aerial photographs taken before and after the 1992 Mw 7.3 Landers earthquake. COSI-Corr offers the advantage of measuring displacement across the entire zone of surface deformation and over a wider aperture than that available to field geologists. For the Landers earthquake, our measured displacements are systematically larger than the field measurements, indicating the presence of off-fault deformation. We show that 46\% of the total surface displacement occurred as off-fault deformation, over a mean deformation width of 154 m. The magnitude and width of off-fault deformation along the rupture is primarily controlled by the macroscopic structural complexity of the fault system, with a weak correlation with the type of near-surface materials through which the rupture propagated. Both the magnitude and width of distributed deformation are largest in stepovers, bends, and at the southern termination of the surface rupture. We find that slip along the surface rupture exhibits a consistent degree of variability at all observable length scales and that the slip distribution is self-affine fractal with dimension of 1.56.},

The nature of the singular stress field postulated by linear elastic analysis was verified and the strength of the singularity was obtained by plotting the variation of fringe order as a function of radial distance from the sharp corner on a logarithmic scale. The experimental results were found to be in good agreement with the theoretical predictions. The effect of interface friction and the effect of rounding off the sharp edge are briefly discussed.},

Concentration in strain is enhanced in deforming continua where viscosity is non-Newtonian, and hence where strain rates vary with deviatoric stress raised to a power greater than one, as is the case for rock-forming minerals at low temperatures characteristic of the lithosphere. Conversely, in regions where deformation is spread over a wide region, such as in the Basin and Range Province of the western United States or in the high interior of the Tibetan Plateau, the absence of strong objects may allow deformation to be diffuse without the development of rapidly slipping faults.},

Because different authors use the words ``dynamic topography'' differently, topography designated as dynamic may amount to only a few hundred meters or may exceed 2000 m. For most regions, however, surface heights computed on the assumption that the lithospheric column is in isostatic equilibrium provide good approximations to observed topography. The small free-air gravity anomalies and still smaller isostatic anomalies ({$<\sptilde$}30\textendash 50 mGal) associated with long-wavelength topography suggest that deflections of the Earth's surface induced by flow-induced normal tractions applied to the base of the lithosphere do not exceed \textasciitilde 300 m. Little evidence exists to show that such tractions support more than \textasciitilde 100 m of high terrain in regions like southern Africa, the Rocky Mountains and Colorado Plateau of the USA, eastern Asia, or the Aegean-Anatolian region, where some have argued for many hundreds to {$>$}2000 m of dynamic topography. Moreover, simple examples show that if flow-induced stresses maintain a given density distribution, then the resultant surface deflections can be smaller than those that would exist in isostatic equilibrium. In light of confusion over the term ``dynamic topography,'' we offer readers simple tools that we hope will enable them to diagnose the component of topography that results from flow-induced stresses and to distinguish it from topography that is compensated isostatically.},

Right-lateral strikeslip faulting occurs on north-northeast planes and left-lateral faulting on westnorthwest planes. Southeast China, in contrast, is quite stable. An analogy is drawn between the tectonics and stability of these regions and the deformation and displacement in a two-dimensional rigidplastic medium bounded laterally and indented at one end near a corner by a rigid indenter (Fig. 4). The slip-line field agrees in sense and orientation with the strike-slip faulting in northeast China and therefore with the inferred orientation of principal stresses. The orientation of the least compressive stress agrees with the direction of extension in regions of normal faulting. The stability of the region analogous to southeast China is predicted also. Thus, we associate the tectonics (or lack of it) in eastern China to the India-Eurasia collision at the Himalaya and to the lack of significant horizontal compressive stress transmitted across the island arcs in the western Pacific.},

We present a theoretical model for an elastically loaded ductile shear zone deforming by combined dislocation and diffusion creep, in which grain size is allowed to evolve toward its equilibrium (recrystallized) value. Several grain size evolution laws are considered. Simulations of laboratory experiments show that grain size evolution can lead to changes in the dominant deformation mechanism that are accompanied by transient strain-weakening or strainstrengthening episodes reminiscent of laboratory observations. Ductile shear zones can also produce postseismic creep as observed in geodetic data following large earthquakes. Non-steady-state ductile creep is difficult to differentiate from frictional sliding with velocity-strengthening friction. Hence, ductile creep may play a role in the transition from velocity-weakening to velocity-strengthening friction with increasing temperature.},

  abstract = {Particle-based numerical simulations of cohesive contractional wedges can yield important perspectives on the formation and evolution of fold and thrust belts, offering particular insights into the mechanical evolution of the systems. Results of several discrete element method simulations are presented here, demonstrating the stress and strain evolution of systems with different initial cohesive strengths. Particle assemblages consolidated under gravity, and bonded to impart cohesion, are pushed from the left at a constant velocity above a weak, unbonded d\'ecollement surface. Internal thrusting causes horizontal shortening and vertical thickening, forming wedge geometries. The mean wedge taper is similar for all simulations, consistent with their similar residual and basal sliding friction values. In all examples presented here, both forethrusts and back thrusts occur, but forethrusts accommodate most of the shortening. Fault spacing and offset increase with increasing cohesion. Significant tectonic volume strain also occurs, with the greatest incremental volume strain occurring just outboard of the deformation front. This diffuse shortening serves to strengthen the unfaulted domain in front of the deformed wedge, preconditioning these materials for brittle (dilative) failure. The reach of this volumetric strain and extent of d\'ecollement slip increase with cohesive strength, defining the extent of stress transmission. Stress paths for elements tracked through the simulations demonstrate systematic variations in shear stress in response to episodes of both d\'ecollement slip and thrust fault activity, providing a direct explanation for stress fluctuations during convergence.},

The rift basins developed on continental blocks that were extruded southeastwards. Hence their development must be tied into Himalayan extrusion tectonics. Current tectonic models propose that the Tertiary basins opened up as pull-apart basins associated with strike-slip faults. Published geochronology of strike-slip fault zone rocks, mapping of fault patterns in the Tertiary basins and mapped releasing-restraining bend geometries all indicate that in Thailand major sinistral strike-slip motion ceased at about 30 Ma, prior to the formation of most rift basins the Thailand. The effects of later dextral slip were minor and probably a result of reactivation during episodes of inversion during NW\textendash SE to NE\textendash SW (Himalayan) compression. Dextral slip was not responsible for opening most of the rift basins in Thailand. An alternative mechanism to open the rift basins is subduction rollback of the Indian plate to the west of Thailand. It is proposed that subuction rollback can help explain some of the characteristics of the rift basins such as non-uniform lithospheric extension, deep sag basins, and the diachronous onset and termination of rifting.},

These quadratures have desirable properties such as positivity of weights and interiority of nodes and can readily be used as software libraries where numerical integration within planar polygons is required. We have used this algorithm for the construction of symmetric and non-symmetric quadrature rules over convex and concave polygons. While in the case of symmetric quadratures our results are comparable to available rules, the proposed algorithm has the advantage of being flexible enough so that it can be applied to arbitrary planar regions for the integration of generalized classes of functions. To demonstrate the efficiency of the new quadrature rules, we have tested them for the integration of rational polygonal shape functions over a regular hexagon. For a relative error of 10-8 in the computation of stiffness matrix entries, one needs at least 198 evaluation points when the region is partitioned, whereas 85 points suffice with our quadrature rule.

  abstract = {The Main Boundary Thrust (MBT) is one of the major Himalayan thrusts occurring during the Cainozoic, and it is presently incorporated within the Himalayan thrust wedge (Lesser and Outer Himalayas) displaced above the Indian lithosphere. Nonetheless the MBT shows recent normal displacement along most of its length. We suggest that the orientation of the major principal stress within the Himalayan thrust wedge deviates significantly from the horizontal and when this deviation exceeds the dip of the vectors normal to back-tilted thrusts, the normal component of displacement may act along these faults. Steep north-dipping segments of the MBT therefore show a normal component of displacement if a geometrical definition is used, but they are faults in a compressional regime where the major principal stress axis has deviated from the horizontal. Micro-structural data recorded along the Surkhet-Ghorahi segment of the MBT are consistent with a strong deviation of the state of stress. The presence of such peculiar normal faulting along the MBT is used to calibrate the mechanical characteristics of the belt considered as a Coulomb wedge. The following characteristics are suggested: (a) very poor strength contrast between basal decollement and rocks in the wedge body, and (b) a high pore fluid pressure ratio (probably close to 0.8-0.9) and a higher fluid pressure ratio (close to 1.0) along the active normal faults if a high internal friction angle (close to the Byerlee value) is considered. The strong deviation in principal stress direction may have recently increased, due to a taper of the Himalayan wedge exceeding the stability boundary and may be controlled by erosion and isostatic uplift rebound of the Himalayan range.},

Using direct dating of fault-zone gouge and strath terrace deposits, we conclude the following. (1) The present mountain front in the Darjiling sub-Himalaya was emplaced by ca. 40 ka. (2) Out-ofsequence deformation on surface-breaking faults north of the MFT in the Darjiling sub-Himalaya began ca. 20 ka and has probably continued since. (3) The Tista River responded to the ca. 20 ka deformation by migrating 150 m eastward (average rate \textasciitilde 13 mm yr\textendash 1) and by incising 48 m vertically (average rate \textasciitilde 4.4 mm yr\textendash 1), creating unpaired, disjointed strath terraces between 11.3 {$\pm$} 1.3 ka and 1.4 {$\pm$} 0.3 ka. Outof-sequence, surface-breaking faults in the Himalaya indicate partial accommodation of active convergence within the Himalayan wedge. Using the results from the Bhuj earthquake of 2001, we suggest that active deformation along the out-of-sequence faults is a potential seismic hazard in the Himalaya, and Himalayan seismic hazard models must account for this. We also propose a conceptual model for active deformation in the Himalaya.},

We completely eliminate this space cost and develop a much more efficient algorithm to perform the reconstruction. By appropriate choice of directions, the reconstruction reduces to a sequence of Lagrange polynomial interpolation problems in Rn-1 for which a divided difference algorithm computes the coefficients of a Newton form. Another algorithm collects like terms from the Newton form and returns the desired multivariate coefficients.},

  abstract = {A Subduction-Transform Edge Propagator (STEP) is the locus of continual lithospheric tearing which enables subduction of one part of a tectonic plate, while the juxtaposed part remains at the surface. A key question is the propagation direction of active STEPs, and we suspect passive margins to play a critical role in steering STEPs. We investigate the role of passive margins (width, orientation, and lateral strength contrast) on the STEP propagation direction through mechanical finite element models. For straight passive margins, we show that STEPs remain parallel to passive margins when within 15\textdegree{} from a trench-perpendicular geometry. In other cases, where passive margins change strike ahead of the active STEP, STEPs are captured by passive margins for abrupt strike changes (radius of curvature {$<$} lithosphere thickness) less than 25\textdegree{} from trench perpendicular. Outside this window, STEPs will propagate in the original direction. If a strike change ({$>$}25\textdegree ) is made through a large radius of curvature ({$>$}lithosphere thickness), STEPs will also propagate along the passive margin. A STEP system evolves toward orthogonality, which may explain why STEP faults are approximately perpendicular to trenches in nature. STEP systems are relatively insensitive to small-scale details (due to large-scale stresses), propagating as straight features along rugged passive margins. Surprisingly, magnitudes of lithospheric strength variation across the passive margin and subduction history, which determines location and magnitude of density anomalies in the mantle, are less relevant for the STEP propagation direction.},

The crack is modeled by the symmetric Galerkin boundary element method, as a distribution of displacement discontinuities, as if in an infinite medium. The finite element method is used to perform the stress analysis for the uncracked body only. The solution for the structural component, containing the crack, is obtained in an iteration procedure, which alternates between FEM solution for the uncracked body, and the SGBEM solution for the crack in an infinite body. Numerical procedures, and the attendant Java code, are developed for the evaluation of stress intensity factors, and fatigue crack growth modeling. Examples for non-planar cracks in infinite media, and for planar cracks in finite bodies, as well as their growth under fatigue, demonstrate the accuracy of the method.},

The application of elastic dislocation theory to these problems, however, may be biased because of numerical instabilities in the calculations. Here, we present a new method that is free of artefact singularities and numerical instabilities in analytical solutions for triangular dislocations (TDs) in both full-space and half-space. We apply the method to both the displacement and the stress fields. The entire 3-D Euclidean space R3 is divided into two complementary subspaces, in the sense that in each one, a particular analytical formulation fulfils the requirements for the ideal, artefact-free solution for a TD. The primary advantage of the presented method is that the development of our solutions involves neither numerical approximations nor series expansion methods. As a result, the final outputs are independent of the scale of the input parameters, including the size and position of the dislocation as well as its corresponding slip vector components. Our solutions are therefore well suited for application at various scales in geoscience, physics and engineering. We validate the solutions through comparison to other well-known analytical methods and provide the MATLAB codes.},

  abstract = {We investigate mountain building in the Altai range of western Mongolia, focusing on Baatar Hyarhan, a NW-trending massif bounded by active thrust faults. Our primary aims are to describe how thrusting has evolved over time, to calculate late Quaternary slip rates by dating offset alluvial markers with optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and to compare these late Quaternary rates with measurements of deformation on decadal and geological timescales. Patterns of topography and drainage suggest that Baatar Hyarhan has grown in length and has propagated laterally from the SE towards the NW over time. On the NE side of the massif, the range-bounding Zereg fault appears active only along younger parts of Baatar Hyarhan; next to the oldest, SE part of the massif faulting has migrated into the adjacent Zereg Basin, where it has uplifted low, linear ridges of folded sediment, known locally as forebergs. On the SW side of the massif, only the range-bounding Tsetseg fault appears active. Using OSL, we establish ages of {$\sim$}15, {$\sim$}20 and {$\sim$}85 kyr for alluvial deposits cut by these faults. These ages are close to those of alluvial markers in the separate Gobi Altai range, suggesting that periods of fan and terrace formation may correlate over wide tracts of Mongolia, presumably under the primary control of climate. Combining our OSL ages with offsets measured with differential GPS, we calculate Late Quaternary slip rates across forebergs in the Zereg Basin and across the range-bounding Zereg and Tsetseg faults. Uncertainties in fault dip (due to lack of clear fault exposures) and burial ages (due to incomplete resetting of the luminescence clock) mean that the exact slip rates are poorly constrained. Nevertheless, the vertical displacement rates we calculate across the Zereg and Tsetseg range-front faults\textemdash 0.2\textendash 0.6 and 0.1\textendash 0.4 mm yr-1, respectively\textemdash are at the lower end of long-term ({$\sim$}5 Myr) estimates of 0.4\textendash 0.8 and 0.3\textendash 0.7 mm yr-1, respectively. Vertical rates of deformation may, therefore, have remained constant over the past {$\sim$}5 Myr, but equally the late Quaternary rates might be lower than the geological ones. This possible discrepancy could be accounted for if some of the shortening has shifted away from the range-front faults onto other nearby structures. The forebergs in the eastern Zereg Basin are an obvious candidate, but they show at least 10 km cumulative shortening (which would take a few Ma to accumulate at late Quaternary rates) and cannot simply be regarded as the latest stage of outward mountain growth. The total Late Quaternary shortening rate across all three areas of faulting is 0.7\textendash 2.4 mm yr-1, making up between one tenth and one third of the {$\sim$}7 mm yr-1 convergence across the whole Altai range.},

  abstract = {Extension along the eastern margin of Eurasia has been regarded commonly as a far-field effect of the India-Eurasia collision. However, some aspects of the timing and location of this extension make a link between the collision and extension difficult. We suggest that some extensional features commonly interpreted as effects of the collision may be related more simply to changes in plate-convergence rates along the eastern plate boundary of Eurasia. An analysis of the motion of the Pacific plate relative to Eurasia suggests that the rate of Pacific-Eurasia convergence varied significantly during the Tertiary Period. From a Late Cretaceous convergence rate of ϳ120 \textendash 140 mm/yr, the rate declined substantially during early Tertiary time and reached a minimum in Eocene time of ϳ30 \textendash{} 40 mm/yr. In Oligocene to earliest Miocene time, the average convergence rate increased moderately to 70 \textendash 95 mm/yr, then decreased again to 65\textendash 70 mm/yr during early to middle Miocene time. From late Miocene to the present, the rate of convergence increased to an average of 100 \textendash 110 mm/yr. The Paleocene through middle Miocene episode of relatively slow convergence correlates with a period of widespread extension along the eastern margin of Eurasia. Decreased convergence may have been related to a net reduction in horizontal compressional stress transmitted between the Pacific and Eurasian plates, which resulted in widespread extension adjacent to the margin of Eurasia.},

  abstract = {For sensitive detection of anomalous seismicity such as quiescence and activation in a given region, we need a suitable statistical reference model that represents a normal seismic activity in the region. The regional occurrence rate of the earthquakes is modeled as a function of previous activity, the specific form of which is based on empirical laws in time and space such as the modified Omori formula and the Utsu\textendash Seki scaling law of aftershock area against magnitude, respectively. This manuscript summarizes the development of the epidemic type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model and proposes an extended version of the best fitted space\textendash time model that was suggested in Ogata [Ogata, Y., 1998. Space\textendash time point-process models for earthquake occurrences, Ann. Inst. Statist. Math., 50: 379\textendash 402.]. This model indicates significantly better fit to seismicity in various regions in and around Japan.},

H-matrices, which are efficient low-rank compressed representations of dense matrices, enable more rapid arithmetic operations with less memory sizes. In this study, we constructed a friction model of quasi-dynamic earthquake cycles on a flat, dipping, plate interface in a semi-infinite homogeneous elastic medium, and investigated the effectiveness of H-matrices by changing N from 104 to 106. Construction of H-matrices involves several parameters controlling the structure and accuracy of the approximated matrix. With H-matrices using proper values for these parameters to maintain accuracy, except for smaller values of the parameter for suppressing the ranks of the outermost submatrices, the memory size of the matrix was reduced to about O(N). The computational time in the multiplication was also reduced to O(N) for a range of N values less than about 105, and to O(N) {$\sim$} O(NlogN) for a larger range. Thus, we found that the application of H-matrices greatly reduces the computational time and memory size in earthquake cycle simulations. This advance should enable the realization of large- and multi-scale simulations with a million order cells and the estimation of frictional parameters.},

Focusing on the evolution of a single normal fault, we show that surface processes significantly enhance the amount of horizontal extension a fault can accommodate before being abandoned in favor of a new fault. In simulations with very slow erosion rates, a 15 km thick brittle layer extends via a succession of crosscutting short-lived faults (heave {$<$} 5 km). By contrast, when erosion rates are comparable to the regional extension velocity, deformation is accommodated on long-lived faults (heave {$>$}10 km). Using simple scaling arguments, we quantify the effect of surface mass removal on the force balance acting on a growing normal fault. This leads us to propose that the major range-bounding normal faults observed in many continental rifts owe their large offsets to erosional and depositional processes.},

Our model builds on classic finite extension theory but incorporates rotation of the active fault plane as a response to the buildup of bending stresses with increasing extension. We postulate that fault plane rotation acts to minimize the amount of extensional work required to sustain slip on the fault. In an elastic layer, this assumption results in rapid rotation of the active fault plane from \textasciitilde 60\textdegree{} down to 30\textendash 45\textdegree{} before fault heave has reached \textasciitilde 50\% of the faulted layer thickness. Commensurate but overall slower rotation occurs in faulted layers of finite strength. Fault rotation rates scale as the inverse of the faulted layer thickness, which is in quantitative agreement with 2-D geodynamic simulations that include an elastoplastic description of the lithosphere. We show that fault rotation promotes longer-lived fault extension compared to continued slip on a high-angle normal fault and discuss the implications of such a mechanism for fault evolution in continental rift systems and oceanic spreading centers.},

The regional consistency of these data indicates that the entire eastern margin of theTibetan Plateau was being dissected by 10 Ma and that incision has been relatively constant and uniform in the region since that time; this pattern is consistent with an erosional response to broad regional uplift at or before 10 Ma. The larger amount, and earlier onset, of exhumation observed in the Yalong River gorge shows that certain areas on the eastern margin deviate from a simple regional pattern of epeirogenic uplift and subsequent river incision and probably reflect the superposition of local upper-crustal deformation and uplift on the broad regional pattern.},

  abstract = {Q-Morph is a new algorithm for generating all-quadrilateral meshes on bounded three-dimensional surfaces. After first triangulating the surface, the triangles are systematically transformed to create an all-quadrilateral mesh. An advancing front algorithm determines the sequence of triangle transformations. Quadrilaterals are formed by using existing edges in the triangulation, by inserting additional nodes, or by performing local transformations to the triangles. A method typically used for recovering the boundary of a Delaunay mesh is used on interior triangles to recover quadrilateral edges. Any number of triangles may be merged to form a single quadrilateral. Topological clean-up and smoothing are used to improve final element quality. Q-Morph generates well-aligned rows of quadrilaterals parallel to the boundary of the domain while maintaining a limited number of irregular internal nodes. The proposed method also offers the advantage of avoiding expensive intersection calculations commonly associated with advancing front procedures. A series of examples of Q-Morph meshes are also presented to demonstrate the versatility of the proposed method. Copyright 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Here we attempt to assess the seismotectonics of these earthquakes based on the deformational field generated by these events, along with the spatial and temporal characteristics of their aftershocks. When integrated with some of the post-earthquake field observations, including the localization of damage and surface deformation, it became obvious that although the mainshock slip was mostly limited to the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT), the rupture did not propagate to the Main Frontal Thrust (MFT). Field evidence, supported by the available InSAR imagery of the deformation field, suggests that a component of slip could have emerged through a previously identified out-of-sequence thrust/active thrust in the region that parallels the Main Central Thrust (MCT), known in the literature as a co-linear physiographic transitional zone called PT2. Termination of the first rupture, triggering of the second large earthquake, and distribution of aftershocks are also spatially constrained by the eastern extremity of PT2. Mechanism of the 2015 sequence demonstrates that the out-of-sequence thrusts may accommodate part of the slip, an aspect that needs to be considered in the current understanding of the mechanism of earthquakes originating on the MHT.},

  abstract = {There have been several recent studies concerning feedforward networks and the problem of approximating arbitrary functionals of a finite number of real variables. Some of these studies deal with cases in which the hidden-layer nonlinearity is not a sigmoid. This was motivated by successful applications of feedforward networks with nonsigmoidal hidden-layer units.             This paper reports on a related study of radial-basis-function (RBF) networks, and it is proved that RBF networks having one hidden layer are capable of universal approximation. Here the emphasis is on the case of typical RBF networks, and the results show that a certain class of RBF networks with the same smoothing factor in each kernel node is broad enough for universal approximation.},

Since a common use of a large matrix like H is to compute its product with various vectors, we derive a technique that directly calculates Hv, where v is an arbitrary vector. To calculate Hv, we first define a differential operator R               v               \{f(w)\} = ({$\delta$}/{$\delta$}r)f(w + rv)|r=0, note that R               v               \{{$\bigtriangledown$}w\} = Hv and R               v               \{w\} = v, and then apply R               v               \{{$\cdot\rbrace$} to the equations used to compute {$\bigtriangledown$}               w               . The result is an exact and numerically stable procedure for computing Hv, which takes about as much computation, and is about as local, as a gradient evaluation. We then apply the technique to a one pass gradient calculation algorithm (backpropagation), a relaxation gradient calculation algorithm (recurrent backpropagation), and two stochastic gradient calculation algorithms (Boltzmann machines and weight perturbation). Finally, we show that this technique can be used at the heart of many iterative techniques for computing various properties of H, obviating any need to calculate the full Hessian.\vphantom\}},

The regions can be isolated within an elastic background or also embedded among themselves. The method is based on the indirect boundary element method (IBEM) in which the diffracted field is obtained as the contributions of distributed sources along the regions boundaries. This is somehow reminiscent of Huygens's Principle for wave fronts. The fields emitted by the sources are computed in frequency domain using analytical expressions of Green's functions for displacements and tractions. This approach is validated, in the antiplane case, by comparing against a semianalytical solution for a basin composed of concentric semi-circular layers and embedded in a half-space. Finally, an example of in-plane wave propagation is given for a complex configuration involving five interlocked regions.},

We propose a gravity- and topography-based model which accounts for constraints provided by other independent results from xenolith and tomography studies. Deviations of the measured gravity from the theoretical Airy-compensation model are examined. A long-wavelength low-gravity anomaly is spatially correlated with low pressure and shear velocity anomalies in the mantle, and with the extent of Cenozoic volcanic outcrops. We interpret it as a deep-seated low-density asthenosphere and model its effect on the Bouguer gravity signal using a 600 km wide light asthenospheric body (density reduction 310 kg m33) located between 100 and 200 km. North and south of the Hangai\^Ho\guillemotleft{} vsgo\guillemotleft{} l dome, short-wavelength highs and lows in the Bouguer gravity field are clearly correlated with fault activity. They seem to reflect opposite senses of flexure of a rigid lithosphere across two major active faults, the Sayan and Bogd transpressional systems, and are modeled by Moho deflections of 10 and 5 km, respectively. Finally, a shortwavelength (200 km), high-amplitude (350 mGal) gravity residual remains beneath the highest part of the mountain bulge, namely the Hangai dome. Based on previously published xenolith analyses, we interpret it as an anomalous, low-density body which may represent underplated cumulates or mafic granulites at the uppermost mantle. We conclude that upper mantle dynamics necessarily play an important role in the origin and evolution of the Hangai\^ Ho\guillemotleft{} vsgo\guillemotleft{} l dome, but without requiring significant thinning of the lithosphere. \ss{} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {The Isabella anomaly is a high seismic velocity anomaly beneath the southern Central Valley of California that has previously been interpreted to represent a lithospheric drip or delaminated Sierra Nevada root. However, recent work suggests that the anomaly is a remnant slab, left over from Cenozoic subduction, attached to the Pacific plate underneath the edge of the North American plate. This hypothesis requires the slab to translate hundreds of kilometers along-strike while remaining intact and attached to the Pacific plate despite drag from the surrounding asthenosphere and overriding lithosphere. We use 3-D finite element models to simulate this scenario, and calculate the viscosity ratio between the slab and the surrounding asthenosphere required for the slab to translate undeformed. The required viscosity ratio increases with increasing downdip extent of the slab, and decreases with increasing slab dip; for geometries approximating that of our proposed slab, the required ratio ranges from 102 to 104. Given the thermal and petrologic history of the slab, mantle flow laws predict viscosity contrasts greater than or equal to these requirements. As such, we conclude that along-strike translation of a remnant slab is feasible, and serves as a possible explanation of the Isabella anomaly. The significance of this finding extends beyond our general understanding of subduction dynamics, in that the presence of such a slab could have implications for the water budget of the San Andreas Fault and its role in aseismic slip.},

  author = {Platt, John D and Rudnicki, John W and Rice, James R},
  pages = {34},
  abstract = {Field and laboratory observations indicate that at seismic slip rates most shearing is confined to a very narrow zone, just a few tens to hundreds of microns wide. Rice et al. [2013] analyzed the stability of shearing in a fluid-saturated gouge material, determining conditions for which uniform shear is unstable. They considered two distinct mechanisms to limit localization to a finite thickness zone, rate-strengthening friction and dilatancy. In this paper we use numerical simulations to extend that beyond their linearized perturbation context work and study the behavior after the loss of stability. Neglecting dilatancy and considering frictional rate-strengthening alone we find that straining localizes to a width that is almost independent of the width of the gouge layer, suggesting that the localized zone width is set by the physical properties of the gouge material. A parameter sweep leads to a formula for the localized zone width that is similar in form to that predicted in Rice et al. [2013]. Choosing parameters thought to be representative of a crustal depth of 7km, this predicts deformation should be confined to a zone between 4 and 44 \textmu m wide. Considering dilatancy alone we again find a localized zone thickness that is independent of gouge layer thickness, and thus a formula for localized zone thickness that is a function of the gouge properties. In addition we study the impact of localization on dynamic weakening. For a thermally driven dynamic weakening mechanism, localization will focus frictional heating into a narrower zone, leading to accelerated weakening. We find that localization leads to substantial strength drops.},

A theoretical characterization of deep learning should answer questions about their approximation power, the dynamics of optimization, and good out-of-sample performance, despite overparameterization and the absence of explicit regularization. We review our recent results toward this goal. In approximation theory both shallow and deep networks are known to approximate any continuous functions at an exponential cost. However, we proved that for certain types of compositional functions, deep networks of the convolutional type (even without weight sharing) can avoid the curse of dimensionality. In characterizing minimization of the empirical exponential loss we consider the gradient flow of the weight directions rather than the weights themselves, since the relevant function underlying classification corresponds to normalized networks. The dynamics of normalized weights turn out to be equivalent to those of the constrained problem of minimizing the loss subject to a unit norm constraint. In particular, the dynamics of typical gradient descent have the same critical points as the constrained problem. Thus there is implicit regularization in training deep networks under exponential-type loss functions during gradient flow. As a consequence, the critical points correspond to minimum norm infima of the loss. This result is especially relevant because it has been recently shown that, for overparameterized models, selection of a minimum norm solution optimizes cross-validation leave-one-out stability and thereby the expected error. Thus our results imply that gradient descent in deep networks minimize the expected error.},

Time series from continuous GPS sites out to 300 km from the ruptures are used to constrain models of postseismic relaxation. Crustal motions in the Mojave Desert region are elevated above background for several years following each event. To account for broadscale relaxation of the lower crust and mantle, the Burgers body model is employed, involving transient and steady state viscosities. Joint afterslip/postseismic relaxation modeling of the GPS time series up to one decade following the Hector Mine earthquake reveals a significant rheological contrast between a northwest trending ``southwest domain'' (that envelopes the San Andreas fault system and western Mojave Desert) and an adjacent ``northeast domain'' (that envelopes the Landers and Hector Mine rupture areas in the central Mojave Desert). The steady state viscosity of the northeast domain mantle asthenosphere is inferred to be {$\sim$}4 times greater than that of the southwest domain. This pattern is counter to that expected for regional heat flow, which is higher in the northeast domain, but it is explicable by means of a nonlinear rheology that includes dependence on both strain rate and water concentration. I infer that the southwest domain mantle has a relatively low steady state viscosity because of its high strain rate and water content. The relatively low mantle water content of the northeast domain is interpreted to result from the continual extraction of water through igneous and volcanic activity over the past {$\sim$}20 Myr.},

  abstract = {Postseismic displacements and strains observed at the earth's surface can be explained through the relaxation of a viscoelastic asthenosphere underlying a purely elastic crust. A theory is presented for modeling the effects of postseismic relaxation on a spherically symmetric earth. For an earthquake point source located in the upper elastic layer, the displacement field is decomposed into its toroidal and spheroidal components. A linear (Maxwell) rheology in the viscoelastic layers is assumed, enabling the use of the correspondence principle for the solutions of the equations of static equilibrium. Displacement and strain fields are then calculated using normal mode summation. Computational results are presented for two simple earthquake sources: a strike slip fault and a uniaxial thrust fault. The patterns of postseismic displacements and strains are found to depend strongly on both the earth model and earthquake source geometry. In particular, the elastic plate thickness, asthenosphere thickness, fault type, and fault length each play a major role in determining the spatial pattern of postseismic relaxation effects. Asthenospheric viscosity controls the temporal pattern of relaxation.},

We find that the signal contained in continuous and campaign global positioning system data for 2.5 years after the earthquake may be explained with a transient rheology. Quantitative modeling of these data with allowance for transient (linear biviscous) rheology in the lower crust and upper mantle demonstrates that transient rheology in the upper mantle is dominant, its material properties being typified by two characteristic relaxation times V0.07 and V2 years. The inferred mantle rheology is a Jeffreys solid in which the transient and steady-state shear moduli are equal. Consideration of a simpler viscoelastic model with a linear univiscous rheology (2 fewer parameters than a biviscous model) shows that it consistently underpredicts the amplitude of the first V3 months signal, and allowance for a biviscous rheology is significant at the 99.0\% confidence level. Another alternative model \^ deep postseismic afterslip beneath the coseismic rupture \^ predicts a vertical velocity pattern opposite to the observed pattern at all time periods considered. Despite its plausibility, the advocated biviscous rheology model is non-unique and should be regarded as a viable alternative to the non-linear mantle rheology model for governing postseismic flow beneath the Mojave Desert.},

Measurement of the motion of the system with a resolution of 8 nm shows that slow creep is actually observed throughout the stick stage and it accelerates as the instability point is approached. This motion is regular enough to serve as a basis for the prediction of the onset of instability. It is shown that the motion of a solid, both at the stage of slow creep and at that of fast slip is well described by Dieterich's friction law, which takes the dependence of friction on sliding velocity and internal state variable into account, if we supplement it with the contribution of local contact compliance. In the immediate vicinity of the instability point, a universal behavior is observed, making highly accurate prediction of the onset of unstable slip from creep observations possible.},

Vital information for these forecasts includes which areas of a fault are locked and how the fault is segmented. Much research has focused on exploring downdip limits to fault rupture from chemical and thermal boundaries, and along-strike barriers from subducted structural features, yet we regularly see only partial rupture of fully locked fault patches that could have ruptured as a whole in a larger earthquake. Here we draw insight into this conundrum from the 25 April 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha (Nepal) earthquake. We invert geodetic data with a structural model of the Main Himalayan thrust in the region of Kathmandu, Nepal, showing that this event was generated by rupture of a d\'ecollement bounded on all sides by more steeply dipping ramps. The morphological bounds explain why the event ruptured only a small piece of a large fully locked seismic gap. We then use dynamic earthquake cycle modeling on the same fault geometry to reveal that such events are predicted by the physics. Depending on the earthquake history and the details of rupture dynamics, however, great earthquakes that rupture the entire seismogenic zone are also possible. These insights from Nepal should be applicable to understanding bounds on earthquake size on megathrusts worldwide.},

  abstract = {Crustal faults and sharp material transitions in the crust are usually represented as triangulated surfaces in structural geological models. The complex range of volumes separating such surfaces is typically three-dimensionally meshed in order to solve equations that describe crustal deformation with the finite-difference (FD) or finite-element (FEM) methods. We show here how the Boundary Element Method, combined with the Multipole approach, can revolutionise the calculation of stress and strain, solving the problem of computational scalability from reservoir to basin scales. The Fast Multipole Boundary Element Method (Fast BEM) tackles the difficulty of handling the intricate volume meshes and high resolution of crustal data that has put classical Finite 3D approaches in a performance crisis. The two main performance enhancements of this method: the reduction of required mesh elements from cubic to quadratic with linear size and linear-logarithmic runtime; achieve a reduction of memory and runtime requirements allowing the treatment of a new scale of geodynamic models. This approach was recently tested and applied in a series of papers by [1, 2, 3] for regional and global geodynamics, using KD trees for fast identification of near and far-field interacting elements, and MPI parallelised code on distributed memory architectures, and is now in active development for crustal dynamics. As the method is based on a free-surface, it allows easy data transfer to geological visualisation tools where only changes in boundaries and material properties are required as input parameters. In addition, easy volume mesh sampling of physical quantities enables direct integration with existing FD/FEM code.},

  abstract = {We consider a very simple model in the framework of differential viscoelastic materials which are isotropic and incompressible. In this model the Cauchy stress tensor is split in an elastic part and a dissipative part. The elastic part is derived from a strain-energy density function only of the first invariant of the Cauchy\textendash Green strain tensor. The dissipative part is like the Navier\textendash Stokes equations: linear in the stretching tensor with a constant viscosity parameter. For this model we provide some time and spatial estimates in the quasistatic approximations for the equations governing anti-plane shear motions. Several explicit examples for specific form of the strain energy are produced. Our results impose analytical restrictions on the mathematical properties of the strain energy to ensure a physical behavior in the creep and recovery experiments. Moreover, we show polynomial decay for the spatial behavior in the class of stress-hardening (or strain-stiffening) materials. For stress-softening materials a Phragmen\textendash Lindelof alternative is proved.},

However, most studies have concentrated on the southern segment of the fault from Yingxiu to Beichuan. Here we opened trenches and used borehole drilling in Guixi and Pingxi along the northern segment (north of Beichuan) with the following paleoseismic results: (1) Trenches at Pingxi and Guixi reveal that at least one paleoseismic event occurred prior to the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake with ages of 770\textendash 955 A.D. and 665\textendash 1030 A.D. determined at the two locations, respectively. This event is possibly associated with a historical earthquake documented from 16 November to 15 December of 942 A.D.; furthermore, the trench and boreholes at Guixi may reveal another paleoseismic event occurred at 8240\textendash 7785 B.C.; (2) the northern segment (north of Beichuan) of the seismogenic structure of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake ruptured independently from the southern segment; specifically, the southern segment records three events within the past 6000 years, whereas the northern segment shows a different rupture behavior. We suggest that the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault can be divided into at least two rupture segments.},

To reveal paleoseismic behaviors in this region, we conducted a paleoseismic study along the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake fault scarp at the town of Yingxiu along the Beichuan\textendash Yingxiu fault. Through a trench investigation, geomorphic analysis and radiocarbon dating, we interpret the occurrence of three paleoseismic events (including the Wenchuan earthquake) within the past 6000 years. The cumulative vertical displacement resulting from the three seismic events is \textasciitilde{} 7.6 m. The coseismic uplift for the Wenchuan earthquake is \textasciitilde{} 2.4 m. Integrated with previous paleoseismic results along the fault, the age of the penultimate event is constrained between 3300 and 2300 cal BP. We suggest the antepenultimate event occurred later than 5920\textendash 5730 cal BP. An average vertical slip rate of 0.88\textendash 0.91 mm/year is calculated from the vertical displacement of U2 since 5940\textendash 5730 cal BP. We estimate that an average recurrence interval of large earthquakes is at most 3000 years. Furthermore, the three paleoseismic events revealed at Yingxiu show similar coseismic vertical displacements. We propose that the strain accumulation and deformation across the Longmenshan fault zone is a relatively stable and continuous process since late Quaternary.},

  abstract = {In historical records, no earthquake of magnitude comparable with that of the Wenchuan Mw 7.9 earthquake has ever been reported in Chengdu and Longmenshan regions. It is important, therefore, to assess if there is any evidence of prior large earthquakes in the recent geological record. In order to explore this problem, 3 trenches were excavated separately at 3 sites along the surface rupture zones in the middle segment of the Beichuan\textendash Yingxiu Fault and Jiangyou\textendash Guanxian Fault of the Longmenshan fault zone, and the offsets of geomorphic surfaces were measured in the trenches. The basic facts of recurrence of large earthquake on the seismogenic fault of the Wenchuan earthquake are demonstrated in this paper on the basis of the accumulated deformation amounts of old and young geomorphic surfaces as well as the paleoearthquake events revealed in the trenches. The document that at Leigu along the Beichuan\textendash Yingxiu Fault, at Bailu along the Jiangyou\textendash Guanxian Fault, and Xiaoyudong on a NW-trending fault, the height of fault scarp on the second terrace has a multiple relationship to that on the first terrace after the Wenchuan earthquake of 12, May. The elevation difference of the marker horizon (the yellow sandy clay bed) of the second terrace revealed in the trenches on both sides of the fault is nearly twice (or three times larger in Bailu) of that produced by the Wenchuan earthquake. These observations suggest the occurrences of paleoearthquake events with surface deformation comparable to that produced by the Wenchuan Mw 7.9 earthquake. According to the dating data and the fact that there is no such slip of comparable paleoearthquakes in the 2300-year-long historic literature in Longmenshan region, we suggest that the penultimate event occurred between 2300 a BP and 3300 a BP.},

Erosion also affects the topographic form and kinematics of orogens, and it may provide dynamic feedbacks between climate and tectonics by spatially focused erosion and rock uplift. Thermochronology measures the timing and rates at which rocks approach the surface and cool as a result of exhumation. Relatively well-understood noble gas and fission-track thermochronometric systems have closure temperatures ranging from {$\sim$}60 to {$\sim$}550{$\smwhtcircle$}C, making them sensitive to exhumation through crustal depths of about one to tens of kilometers. Thus, thermochronology can constrain erosion rates and their spatial-temporal variations on timescales of {$\sim$}105\textendash 107 years, commensurate with orogenic growth and decay cycles and possible climate-tectonic feedback response times. Useful methods for estimating erosion rates include inverting ages for erosion rates using crustal thermal models, vertical transects, and detrital approaches. Spatial-temporal patterns of thermochronometrically determined erosion rates help constrain flow of material through orogenic wedges, orogenic growth and decay cycles, paleorelief, and relationships with structural, geomorphic, or climatic features.},

  abstract = {We summarize studies of earthquake fault models that give rise to slip complexities like those in natural earthquakes. For models of smooth faults between elastically deformable continua, it is critical that the friction laws involve a characteristic distance for slip weakening or evolution of surface state. That results in a finite nucleation size, or coherent slip patch size, h*. Models of smooth faults, using numerical cell size properly small compared to h*, show periodic response or complex and apparently chaotic histories of large events but have not been found to show small event complexity like the self-similar (power law) GutenbergRichter frequency-size statistics. This conclusion is supported in the present paper by fully inertial elastodynamic modeling of earthquake sequences. In contrast, some models of locally heterogeneous faults with quasi-independent fault segments, represented approximately by simulations with cell size larger than h* so that the model becomes "inherently discrete," do show small event complexity of the GutenbergRichter type. Models based on classical friction laws without a weakening length scale or for which the numerical procedure imposes an abrupt strength drop at the onset of slip have h* = 0 and hence always fall into the inherently discrete class. We suggest that the small-event complexity that some such models show will not survive regularization of the constitutive description, by inclusion of an appropriate length scale leading to a finite h*, and a corresponding reduction of numerical grid size.},

  abstract = {Field observations of major earthquake fault zones show that the majority of shear deformation is confined to principal slipping zones that may be of order 10-100\textmu m wide, located within a broader gouge layer of order 10 - 100mm wide. This paper examines the possibility that the extreme strain localization observed may be due to the coupling of shear heating, thermal pressurization and diffusion. It has been noted that in the absence of a stabilizing mechanism, shear deformation in a continuum analysis will collapse to an infinitesimally thin zone [Rice, 2006]. Two such possible stabilizing mechanisms, studied in this paper, are rate-strengthening friction and dilatancy. For rate-strengthening friction alone, a linear stability analysis shows that uniform shear of a gouge layer is unstable for perturbations exceeding a critical wavelength. Using this critical wavelength we predict a width for the localized zone as a function of the gouge properties. Taking representative parameters for fault gouge at typical centroidal depths of crustal seismogenic zones, we predict localized zones of order 5-40 \textmu m wide, roughly consistent with field and experimental observations. For dilatancy alone, linearized strain rate perturbations with a sufficiently large wavelength will undergo transient exponential growth before decaying back to uniform shear. The total perturbation strain accumulated during this transient strain rate localization is shown to be largely controlled by a single parameter E = {$\epsilon$}/{$\beta\sigma$}\textasciimacron a, where {$\sigma$}\textasciimacron a is the ambient effective normal stress, {$\beta$} is the hydraulic storage capacity, and {$\epsilon$} is a measure of the dilatancy of the gouge material due to an increase in strain rate. When E = 0 our model reduces to ideal plasticity and the shear will localize to a plane; E {$>$} 0 leads to finite thickness shear zones, with larger values of E corresponding to wider shear zones.},

This data set is an order of magnitude larger than used for S20RTS and includes new data types. The data are related to shear-velocity perturbations from the (anisotropic) PREM model via kernel functions and ray paths that are computed using PREM. Contributions to phase delays and traveltimes from the heterogeneous crust are estimated using model CRUST2.0. We calculate crustal traveltimes from long-period synthetic waveforms rather than using ray theory. Shear-velocity perturbations are parametrized by spherical harmonics up to degree 40 and by 21 vertical spline functions for a total of 35 301 degrees of freedom. S40RTS is characterised by 8000 resolved unknowns. Since we compute the exact inverse, it is straightforward to determine models associated with fewer or more unknowns by adjusting the model damping. S40RTS shares many characteristics with S20RTS because it is based on the same data types and similar modelling procedures. However, S40RTS shows more clearly than S20RTS the abrupt change in the pattern of shear-velocity heterogeneity across the 660-km phase transition and it presents a more complex patern of shear-velocity heterogeneity in the lower mantle. Utilities to visualise S40RTS and software to analyse the resolution of S40RTS (or models for different damping parameters) are made available.},

Different models interpret the Karakorum fault as either: 1) a long-lived, stable feature analogous to a plate boundary structure, or 2) an evolving fault system with limited displacement (b 200 km) and transient kinematics. While active deformation along the southern segment of the Karakorum fault is well established, neotectonic activity along the fault north of its intersection with the active left-slip Longmu\textendash Co Gozha\textendash Co fault system has not been documented. Analysis of Corona and ASTER satellite images along the northern end of the Karakorum fault zone provide several lines of evidence that show this portion is no longer active: 1) multiple generations of Quaternary glacial and fluvial deposits which can be correlated with previously dated deposits in the region, the oldest of which are N 150 ka, overly the trace of the two strands of the Karakorum fault and show no evidence of tectonic disturbance; 2) older (late Pliocene to early Quaternary) loess deposits which overlie the trace of the fault are either undisturbed, or are cut by small normal fault scarps with no evidence of strike-slip displacement; 3) east\textendash west trending bedrock incised stream valleys up to 500 m deep cross both strands of the fault with no sign of lateral deflection. I suggest that termination of slip along the northern segment of the Karakorum fault occurred in the Pliocene due to southward propagation of the Altyn Tagh fault system along the Longmu\textendash Co Gozha Co fault and impingement of the Karakorum fault. This study suggests that large intracontinental strike-slip faults embedded within orogenic plateaus are transient features which should be expected to have complicated kinematic histories and short life-spans relative to the life of an orogenic belt.},

Using satellite images, I have correlated a well defined carbonate unit, the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic Aghil formation, across the northern portion of the Karakorum fault from the southwest Pamir to the Tianshuihai terrane of western Tibet. The northern and southern exposure limits of the Aghil formation have 149\textendash 167 km of separation, which I interpret to represent the magnitude of displacement on the northern Karakorum fault. These values overlap with estimates correlating the Bangong-Nujiang and Shyok sutures across the central Karakorum fault and maximum offsets of the Miocene Baltoro Granite and rule out correlations of the Bangong-Nujiang suture and the Rushan Pshart suture. The displacement yields a geologic slip rate of 10.8 {$\pm$} 1.3 mm/yr using an initiation age of 14.7 {$\pm$} 1 Ma, or 6.89 {$\pm$} 0.8 mm/yr with an initiation age of 23 {$\pm$} 1 Ma. This result supports previous work showing limited offset across the Karakorum fault and indicates that the fault that has not accommodated either large magnitudes (i.e. 100's of km) of eastward lateral extrusion of Tibet or hundreds of kilometers of offset between terranes of the western and central portions of the orogenic belt.},

In the Taconian, the passive margin of Laurentia was subducted below a complex magmatic arc lasting from 480 to 442 Ma, founded in part on continental crust of a Medial New England terrane with possible affinities with Amazonia. Questions about Medial New England involve its coherence as a single plate, and the nature of its underlying crust. The Acadian began in Late Silurian as a collision between the amalgamated Laurentia-Medial New England and outer belts of Composite Avalon along a cryptic suture in coastal Maine, and progressed northwestward to the Connecticut Valley basin by mid-Devonian . Tonalitic-granitic magmatism and up to granulitefacies metamorphism culminated in Early Devonian, possibly tied to lithospheric detachment below the subducting northwestern plate and consequent asthenosphere upwelling. Newly discovered Neo-Acadian Late Devonian to Early Mississippian tonalitic-granitic magmatism, up to granulite-facies metamorphism, and severe deformation in central Massachusetts took place in a plate context poorly understood. Late Pennsylvanian effects include magmatism, metamorphism, and deformation near south New England gneiss domes and the Sebago batholith, and development of the right-lateral Norumbega fau lt system. Permian Alleghanian effects include penetrative deformation, granitic intrusions and up to sillimanite-grade m.etamorphism .of Pennsylvanian beds in southeastern New England.

Samples from the High Peaks section of the Adirondack massif yielded the oldest apatite fission-track ages (168\textendash 135 Ma), indicating that it was exhumed first. Unroofing along the northern, northwestern, and southwestern margins of the Adirondacks began slightly later, as shown by younger apatite fission-track ages (146\textendash 114 Ma) determined for these rocks. This delay in exhumation may have resulted from burial of the peripheral regions by sediment shed from the High Peaks. Apatite fission-track ages for samples from the southeastern Adirondacks are distinctly younger (112\textendash 83 Ma) than those determined for the rest of the Adirondack region. These younger apatite fission-track ages are from a section of the Adirondacks dissected by shear zones and post-Ordovician north-northeast-trending normal faults. Differential unroofing may have been accommodated by reactivation of the faults in a reverse sense of motion with maximum compressive stress, j1, oriented west-northwest. A change in the orientation of the post\textendash Early Cretaceous paleostress field is supported by a change in the trend of Cretaceous lamprophyre dikes from east-west to west-northwest.},

  abstract = {The concavity, or curvature, of river profiles has long been taken to be a fundamental indicator of the underlying processes governing fluvial erosion, and thereby of landscape evolution. However, erosion laws have generally been derived without accounting for the strong orographically driven gradients in precipitation typically found in mountainous regions. In addition, field measurements have found discrepancies between the form of measured stream profiles and theoretically derived values. Introducing a simple physically based feedback, we find that orographically induced variations in precipitation strongly affect the curvature of steady-state river profiles. This feedback complicates efforts to infer the form of erosion laws from observed profile concavities, but could help explain discrepancies between observations and theory. Our results demonstrate a strong feedback through which climate influences the form of river profiles and show how such climatic effects act to limit the relief of unglaciated mountain ranges.},

The general observation of decreasing {$\delta$}18O and {$\delta$}2H values in rainfall as elevation increases has been used in both empirical and theoretical approaches to estimate paleoelevation. These studies rely on the preservation of ancient surface water compositions in authigenic minerals to reconstruct the elevation at the time the minerals were forming. In this review we provide a theory behind the application of stable isotope-based approaches to paleoaltimetry. We apply this theory to test cases using modern precipitation and surface water isotopic compositions to demonstrate that it generally accords well with observations. Examples of the application of paleoaltimetry techniques to Himalaya-Tibet and the Andes are discussed with implications for processes that cause surface uplift.},

Instead, central eastern Tibet has been nearly stationary relative to southeastern China, southeastern Tibet has rotated clockwise without major crustal shortening, and the crust along portions of the eastern plateau margin has been extended. Modeling suggests that these phenomena are the result of continental convergence where the lower crust is so weak that upper crustal deformation is decoupled from the motion of the underlying mantle. This model also predicts east-west extension on the high plateau without convective removal of Tibetan lithosphere and without eastward movement of the crust east of the plateau.},

It includes, among others, (generalized) linear models, (generalized) additive models, smoothing spline models, state space models, semiparametric regression, spatial and spatiotemporal models, log-Gaussian Cox processes and geostatistical and geoadditive models. We consider approximate Bayesian inference in a popular subset of structured additive regression models, latent Gaussian models, where the latent field is Gaussian, controlled by a few hyperparameters and with non-Gaussian response variables. The posterior marginals are not available in closed form owing to the non-Gaussian response variables. For such models, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be implemented, but they are not without problems, in terms of both convergence and computational time. In some practical applications, the extent of these problems is such that Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is simply not an appropriate tool for routine analysis. We show that, by using an integrated nested Laplace approximation and its simplified version, we can directly compute very accurate approximations to the posterior marginals. The main benefit of these approximations is computational: where Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms need hours or days to run, our approximations provide more precise estimates in seconds or minutes. Another advantage with our approach is its generality, which makes it possible to perform Bayesian analysis in an automatic, streamlined way, and to compute model comparison criteria and various predictive measures so that models can be compared and the model under study can be challenged.},

We are concerned with the polyhedron triangulation problem: decomposing a three-dimensional polyhedron into a set of nonoverlapping tetrahedra whose vertices must be vertices of the polyhedron. It has previously been shown that some polyhedra cannot be triangulated in this fashion. We show that the problem of deciding whether a given polyhedron can be triangulated is NP-complete, and hence likely to be computationally intractable. The problem remains NP-complete when restricted to the case of star-shaped polyhedra. Various versions of the question of how many Steiner points are needed to triangulate a polyhedron also turn out to be NP-hard.},

Excess pore pressure is driven by tectonic loading and fluids released by mineral dehydration, and it has profound effects on fault and earthquake mechanics through its control on effective stress. The egress of these overpressured fluids, which is in part governed by the presence of permeable fault zones, is a primary mechanism of volatile and solute transport to the oceans. Recent field measurements, new constraints gained from laboratory studies, and numerical modeling efforts have led to a greatly improved understanding of these coupled processes. Here, we summarize the current state of knowledge of fluid flow and pore pressure in subduction forearcs, and focus on recent advances that have quantified permeability architecture, fluxes, the nature and timing of transience, and pressure distribution, thus providing new insights into the connections between fluid, metamorphic, mechanical, and fault slip processes.},

Here we propose a subspace projection method that allows the use of any iterative scheme able to solve the unconstrained problem, with the same preconditioner.

  abstract = {Focused ultrasound (FUS) is an established technique for non-invasive surgery and has recently attracted considerable attention as a potential method for non-invasive neuromodulation. While the pressure waves in FUS procedures have been extensively studied in this context, the accompanying shear waves are often neglected due to the relatively high shear compliance of soft tissues. However, in bony structures such as the skull, acoustic pressure can also induce significant shear waves that could propagate outside the ultrasound focus. Here, we investigate wave propagation in the human cranium by means of a finite-element model that accounts for the anatomy, elasticity, and viscoelasticity of the skull and brain. We show that, when a region on the scalp is subjected to FUS, the skull acts as a waveguide for shear waves that propagate with a speed close to 1500 m/s, reaching off-target structures such as the cochlea. In particular, when a sharp onset of FUS is introduced in a zone proximal to the intersection of the parietal and temporal cranium, the bone-propagated shear waves reach the inner ear in about 40 ls, leading to cumulative displacements of about 1 lm. We further quantify the effect of ramped and sharp application of FUS on the cumulative displacements in the inner ear. Our results help explain the off-target auditory responses observed during neuromodulation experiments and inform the development of mitigation and sham control strategies.},

  abstract = {During the latest Cretaceous-early Paleogene Laramide orogeny, the lithosphere beneath the southernmost Sierra Nevada batholith and the adjacent Mojave Desert region batholith was sheared off and displaced deeper into the mantle. The lithosphere beneath the greater Sierra Nevada batholith to the north was left intact until mid-Miocene time, when fragments of it were entrained as volcanic xenoliths. The Laramide slab was evidently segmented into a shallow flat segment to the south and a deeper segment to the north. Shearing off of the upper mantle to the south was followed by the tectonic underplating of schists derived from Franciscan subduction complex and possibly forearc basin protoliths. The overlying batholithic crust was deformed, deeply denuded, and tectonically breached westward across its forearc region while the schists were underplated. Westward breachment resulted from a combination of west-directed thrusting and extensional collapse. The westernmost breached rocks were tectonically removed by a combination of trench linked transform and subduction erosion processes. Subsequent tectonic erosion by the Neogene San Andreas transform has left the Salinia and the San Gabriel terranes as dispersed residual fragments of the westward breached arc segment.},

Our findings indicate that root mean square values of abyssal hill heights increase from 220 {$\pm$} 20 m to 300 {$\pm$} 20 m along flow line corridors that transition a well-constrained full spreading rate change from slow (30 mm/yr) to ultra-slow (15 mm/yr). Mantle Bouguer gravity anomalies, however, indicate no significant change in inferred crustal thickness at the spreading rate transition. In the axis-parallel direction, roughness of both slow and ultra-slow seafloor increases from 54\textdegree E to 63\textdegree E while inferred crustal thickness and/or mantle temperature decrease. These findings have implications for the relationship between spreading rate and melt production: they suggest that mantle temperature at slow and ultra-slow ridges may play a more important role than spreading rate in determining seafloor morphology. The lack of evidence for significant crustal thinning accompanying a change from slow to ultra-slow spreading rate lends support to focused subaxial mantle upwelling models.},

Explicitly vectorized variations of the algorithm based on the Gauss-Legendre quadrature are discussed and implemented in the SHTns library which includes scalar and vector transforms. The main breakthrough is to achieve very efficient on-the-fly computations of the Legendre associated functions, even for very high resolutions, by taking advantage of the specific properties of the SHT and the advanced capabilities of current and future computers. This allows us to simultaneously and significantly reduce memory usage and computation time of the SHT. We measure the performance and accuracy of our algorithms. Even though the complexity of the algorithms implemented in SHTns are in O(N 3) (where N is the maximum harmonic degree of the transform), they perform much better than any third party implementation, including lower complexity algorithms, even for truncations as high as N = 1023. SHTns is available at https://bitbucket.org/nschaeff/shtns as open source software.},

  abstract = {The usual time domain Boundary Element Method (BEM) contains fundamental solutions which are convoluted with time-dependent boundary data and integrated over the boundary surface. Here, a new approach for the evaluation of the convolution integrals, the so-called `Operational Quadrature Methods' developed by Lubich, is presented. In this formulation, the convolution integral is numerically approximated by a quadrature formula whose weights are determined using the Laplace transform of the fundamental solution and a linear multistep method. To study the behaviour of the method, the numerical convolution of a fundamental solution with a unit step function is compared with the analytical result. Then, a time domain Boundary Element formulation applying the `Operational Quadrature Methods' is derived. For this formulation only the fundamental solutions in Laplace domain are necessary. The properties of the new formulation are studied with a numerical example.},

  abstract = {Geological observations indicate that along two active continental margins (East Asia and Mediterranean) major phases of overriding plate extension, resulting from subduction hinge-retreat, occurred synchronously with a reduction in subducting plate velocity. In this paper, results of fluid dynamical experiments are presented to test the influence of the velocity of the subducting plate on the hinge-migration velocity and on the geometry of the slab. Results show that hinge-retreat decreases with increasing subducting plate velocity. In addition, phases of hinge-retreat alternate with phases of hinge-advance for relatively high subducting plate velocities due to interaction of the slab with the bottom of the box, simulating the upper\textendash lower mantle discontinuity. Such slab kinematics could explain the episodic behaviour of back-arc opening observed in convergent settings. The geometry of the slab and the kinematics of subduction are significantly affected by the velocity of the subducting plate. Three subduction modes with accompanying slab geometry can be recognized. A relatively low subducting plate velocity is accompanied by relatively fast hinge-retreat with backward sinking of the slab and a backward draping slab geometry. With increasing subducting plate velocity hinge-migration is relatively small, resulting in subvertical sinking of the slab and a folded slab piling geometry. For a very high velocity the hinge migrates forward, resulting in forward oriented subduction vectors and a forward draping slab geometry.},

Deformation has been interpreted to result from extrusion tectonics related to the India\textendash Eurasia collision, which started in the Early Eocene. In East and SE China, however, deformation started earlier than the collision (latest Cretaceous to Palaeocene), suggesting that extrusion tectonics is not the (only) driving mechanism for East Asia deformation. It is suggested that the East Asian active margin has influenced deformation in East Asia significantly. Along the margin, Cenozoic back-arc extension took place behind several adjoining arcs, implying eastward rollback of the subducting slab and collapse of the overriding plate towards the retreating hinge-line. We show that extension took place along a c. 7400 km long stretch of the East Asian margin during most of the Cenozoic. Physical models are presented simulating overriding plate collapse and back-arc extension. The models reproduce important aspects of the strain field in East Asia. For geometrical and rheological conditions scaled to represent East Asia, modelling shows that the active margin can be held responsible for deformation in East Asia as far west as the Baikal rift zone, located c. 3300 km from the margin.},

The wide range of scales encountered lead to the problem that the fastest cell of the simulation dictates the global time step. Multirate time integration methods can be employed to alter the time step locally so that slower components take longer and fewer time steps, resulting in a moderate to substantial reduction of the computational cost, depending on the scenario to simulate [S.

Multirate schemes are a useful tool to decouple different physical regions so that this constraint becomes a local instead of a global restriction. Therefore it is of major interest to apply multirate schemes to the advection equation. We introduce a generic recursive multirate Runge\textendash Kutta scheme that can be easily adapted to an arbitrary number of refinement levels. It preserves the linear invariants of the system and is of third order accuracy when applied to certain explicit Runge\textendash Kutta methods as base method.},

  abstract = {We derive in algebraic form the displacement and stress fields produced by a triangular element of constant slip by superposing the solution of Comninou and Dundurs (1975) for an angular dislocation in an elastic half-space. Triangular elements are more flexible for simulating complex geometries than the rectangular elements widely used for modeling slip zones as a superposition of constant slip elements. As an example, we use triangular elements to determine the distribution of slip on a planar surface caused by a prescribed stress drop. Because the slip in elements is uniform, the slip does not taper to zero at the edges of the slipping zone. Consequently, the strain energy in volumes containing the slip zone edge and the stress drop averaged over the slip zone are unbounded. To investigate the effects of these features, we compare our results using uniform slip elements with those from the more elaborate procedure of Wu et al. (1991) that takes proper account of stress singularity at the edge of the slipping zone. The comparison indicates that, for a prescribed uniform stress drop, the uniform slip model slightly overestimates the free surface displacements. The predicted slip surface displacements are more severely overestimated, particularly near the edges of the slipping zone. Nevertheless, extrapolation of the slip surface displacements yields values for the stress intensity factors, the coefficients of the singular stresses near the edge of a crack. The values of stress intensity factors are within 10\% of those results obtained by Wu et al. (1991) for the same number of elements.},

  abstract = {Significant postseismic deformation of the 2008 MW7.9 Wenchuan earthquake has been observed from GPS data of the first 14 days after the earthquake. The possible mechanisms for the rapid postseismic deformation are assumed to be afterslip on the earthquake rupture plane and viscoelastic relaxation of coseismiclly stress change in the lower crust or upper mantle. We firstly use the constrained least squares method to find an afterslip model which can fit the GPS data best. The afterslip model can explain near-field data very well but shows considerable discrepancies in fitting far-field data. To estimate the effect due to the viscoelastic relaxation in the lower crust, we then ignore the contribution from the afterslip and attempt to invert the viscosity structure beneath the Longmenshan fault where the Wenchuan earthquake occurred from the postseismic deformation data. For this purpose, we use a viscoelastic model with a 2D geometry based on the geological and seismological observations and the coseismic slip distribution derived from the coseismic GPS and InSAR data. By means of a grid search we find that the optimum viscosity is 9\texttimes 1018 Pa{$\cdot$}s for the middle-lower crust in the Chengdu Basin, 4\texttimes 1017 Pa{$\cdot$}s for the middle-lower crust in the Chuanxi Plateau and 7\texttimes 1017 Pa{$\cdot$}s for the low velocity zone in the Chuanxi plateau. The viscoelastic model explains the postseismic deformation observed in the far-field satisfactorily, but it is considerably worse than the afterslip model in fitting the near-fault data. It suggests therefore a hybrid model including both afterslip and relaxation effects. Since the viscoelastic model produces mainly the far-field surface deformation and has fewer degree of freedoms (three viscosity parameters) than the afterslip model with a huge number of source parameters, we fix the viscositiy structure as obtained before but redetermine the afterslip distribution using the residual data from the viscoelastic modeling. The redetermined afterslip distribution becomes physically more reasonable; it is more localized and exhibits a pattern spatially complementary with the coseismic rupture distribution. We conclude that the aseismic fault slip is responsible for the near-fault postseismic deformation, whereas the viscoelastic stress relaxation might be the major cause for the far-field postseismic deformation.},

Are earthquakes fundamentally the same across this huge range of scales, or are the great earthquakes somehow different from the small ones? We show that a robust scaling law seen in small earthquakes, with stress drops being independent of earthquake size, indeed holds for great earthquakes as well. The simplest hypothesis, that earthquake stress drops are constant from the smallest to the largest events, combined with a more thorough treatment of the geometrical effects of the finite seismogenic layer depth gives a new magnitude-area scaling that matches the data well and matches the data better over the whole magnitude range than the currently used scaling laws, which have nonconstant stress-drop scaling. This has significant implications for earthquake physics and for seismic hazard estimates.},

  abstract = {Inland earthquake activity in and around the Kinki region, southwest Japan, increases in the period from several decades before to about a decade after the occurrence of great interplate earthquakes along the Nankai Trough. To quantitatively investigate this relationship, we calculated long-term changes in the Coulomb failure function ({$\Delta$}CFF) on inland active faults in this region with viscoelastic slip response functions. As sources for the change in CFF, we investigated east-west compression within the Niigata-Kobe Tectonic Zone (NKTZ), historical interplate earthquakes and interseismic locking along the Nankai Trough subduction zone, and historical inland earthquakes in this region. Among these sources, the NKTZ east-west compression is the primary cause of the long-term changes in CFF. The changes in CFF due to interplate earthquakes are mostly negative on reverse faults and positive on strike-slip faults. This result suggests that the inland reverse faulting activity mostly increases before interplate earthquakes and decreases after the earthquakes, whereas strike-slip activity is mostly suppressed before interplate earthquakes and increases thereafter. This suggestion is supported by spatiotemporal pattern of historical inland earthquakes if focal mechanisms of historical earthquakes correspond to fault geometries in the region. The calculated changes in CFF are usually consistent with the occurrence of historical inland earthquakes. If we use the change in shear stress instead of the change in CFF, this consistency is enhanced, which suggests low apparent coefficients of friction in this region.},

  abstract = {High order accurate weighted essentially nonoscillatory (WENO) schemes are relatively new but have gained rapid popularity in numerical solutions of hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) and other convection dominated problems. The main advantage of such schemes is their capability to achieve arbitrarily high order formal accuracy in smooth regions while maintaining stable, nonoscillatory, and sharp discontinuity transitions. The schemes are thus especially suitable for problems containing both strong discontinuities and complex smooth solution features. WENO schemes are robust and do not require the user to tune parameters. At the heart of the WENO schemes is actually an approximation procedure not directly related to PDEs, hence the WENO procedure can also be used in many non-PDE applications. In this paper we review the history and basic formulation of WENO schemes, outline the main ideas in using WENO schemes to solve various hyperbolic PDEs and other convection dominated problems, and present a collection of applications in areas including computational fluid dynamics, computational astronomy and astrophysics, semiconductor device simulation, traffic flow models, computational biology, and some non-PDE applications. Finally, we mention a few topics concerning WENO schemes that are currently under investigation.},

Quadrature by expansion (QBX) is a recently introduced method that can offer high accuracy for singular and nearly singular integrals, using truncated expansions to locally represent the potential. The QBX method is typically based on a spherical harmonics expansion which when truncated at order p has O(p2) terms. This expansion can equivalently be written with p terms, however paying the price that the expansion coefficients will depend on the evaluation/target point. Based on this observation, we develop a target specific QBX method, and apply it to Laplace's equation on multiply-connected domains. The method is local in that the QBX expansions only involve information from a neighborhood of the target point. An analysis of the truncation error in the QBX expansions is presented, practical parameter choices are discussed and the method is validated and tested on various problems.},

Complete elastic strain release adjacent to dip-slip faults is inhibited by gravity, so that permanent deformation accumulates in the lithosphere with time. In the models, this permanent deformation is observed at the surface as large-scale upwarping of a hanging wall anticline and depression of an adjacent footwall foreland basin. The results are supported by observation of similar features adjacent to reverse faults in active collisional mountain belts and along the coastal margin of some modern subduction zones.},

Field measurements of narrow (2\textendash 60 m wide) ductile shear zones in harzburgite were used to construct strain profiles, which have maximum shear strains ranging from {$\gamma\frac{1}{4}$} 5.25 to {$\gamma$}420. Measurements of pyroxene water concentrations from harzburgite samples within and immediately adjacent to the shear zones indicate that gradients in water concentration exist on a 10\textendash 100 m scale, even after exhumation. Water concentration measurements are correlated with olivine lattice-preferred orientation (LPO), corroborating experimental results on the influence of water on slip system activity. Using empirical olivine flow laws and the diffusivity of water in olivine, we model initiation of a ductile shear zone through localized water weakening. We demonstrate that this mechanism can readily generate spatial perturbations in both effective viscosity and strain. However this model is not able to reproduce both the observed shear strain gradients and water concentration data from the Josephine shear zones. We evaluate other plausible localization mechanisms, which may amplify this initial strain perturbation. The most relevant at these conditions is the development of viscous anisotropy associated with the evolution of olivine LPO. Using recent experimental results, we demonstrate that progressive rotation of olivine LPO into the shear plane enhances deformation within a shear zone. We conclude that feedback between at least two microphysical processes is needed to account for observed outcrop-scale shear localization.},

Thus splay trees are as efficient as balanced trees when total running time is the measure of interest. In addition, for sufficiently long access sequences, splay trees are as efficient,to within a constant factor, as static optimum search trees. The efficiencyof splay trees comes not from an explicit structural constraint, as with balanced trees, but from applying a simple restructuring heuristic, called splaying,whenever the tree is accessed.

  abstract = {Theoretical calculations indicate that elastic stresses induced by surface topography may be large enough in some landscapes to fracture rocks, which in turn could influence slope stability, erosion rates, and bedrock hydrologic properties. These calculations typically have involved idealized topographic profiles, with few direct comparisons of predicted topographic stresses and observed fractures at specific field sites. We use a numerical model to calculate the stresses induced by measured topographic profiles and compare the calculated stress field with fractures observed in shallow boreholes. The model uses a boundary element method to calculate the stress distribution beneath an arbitrary topographic profile in the presence of ambient tectonic stress. When applied to a topographic profile across the Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory in central Pennsylvania, the model predicts where shear fractures would occur based on a Mohr\textendash Coulomb criterion, with considerable differences in profiles of stresses with depth beneath ridgetops and valley floors. We calculate the minimum cohesion required to prevent shear failure, Cmin, as a proxy for the potential for fracturing or reactivation of existing fractures. We compare depth profiles of Cmin with structural analyses of image logs from four boreholes located on the valley floor, and find that fracture abundance declines sharply with depth in the uppermost 15 m of the bedrock, consistent with the modeled profile of Cmin. In contrast, Cmin increases with depth at comparable depths below ridgetops, suggesting that ridgetop fracture abundance patterns may differ if topographic stresses are indeed important. Thus, the present results are consistent with the hypothesis that topography can influence subsurface rock fracture patterns and provide a basis for further observational tests.

  abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between seismogenic thickness, lithosphere structure and rheology in central and northeastern Asia. We accurately determine earthquake depth distributions which reveal important rheological variations in the lower crust. These variations exert a fundamental control on the active tectonics and the morphological evolution of the continents. We consider 323 earthquakes across the Tibetan Plateau, the Tien Shan and their forelands as well as the Baikal Rift, NE Siberia and the Laptev Sea and present the source parameters of 94 of these here for the first time. These parameters have been determined through body wave inversion, the identification of depth phases or the modelling of regional waveforms. Lower crustal earthquakes are found to be restricted to the forelands in areas undergoing shortening, and to locations where rifting coincides with abrupt changes in lithosphere thickness, such as the NE Baikal Rift and W Laptev Sea. The lower crust in these areas is seismogenic at temperatures that may be as high as 600{$\smwhtcircle$}C, suggesting that it is anhydrous, and is likely to have great long-term strength. Lower crustal earthquakes are therefore a useful proxy indicating strong lithosphere in places that are too small in areal extent for this to be confirmed independently by estimating effective elastic thickness from gravity\textendash topography relations. The variation in crustal rheology indicated by the distribution of lower-crustal earthquakes has many implications ranging from the support of mountain belts and the formation of steep mountain fronts, to the localization and orientation of rifting. In combination, these processes can also be responsible for the separation of the front of the thin-skinned mountain belts from their hinterlands when continents separate.},

In order to solve such problems, the boundary element method (BEM) can be applied. The advantage compared to domain-discretisation-based methods such as finite element methods is that only a discretisation of the boundary is necessary, which significantly reduces the number of unknowns. Yet, BEM formulations are much more difficult to implement than finite element methods. In this article, we present BEM++, a novel open-source library for the solution of boundary integral equations for Laplace, Helmholtz and Maxwell problems in three space dimensions. BEM++ is a C++ library with Python bindings for all important features, making it possible to integrate the library into other C++ projects or to use it directly via Python scripts. The internal structure and design decisions for BEM++ are discussed. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of the library for larger problems.},

Ancient seismicity is attested by the widespread occurrence of cataclasites associated with pseudotachylytes (solidified frictional melts) formed at 9\textendash 11 km depth and ambient temperatures of 250\textendash 300 \textdegree C. Previous work focused on the southern part of the fault zone; here we quantitatively document fault zone structure across the full width of the GLFZ and surrounding tonalite host rocks by using a combination of structural line transects and image analysis of samples collected across fault strike. These new datasets indicate that the GLFZ has a broadly symmetric across-strike damage structure and contains distinct southern, central and northern zones distinguished by large variations in fracture density, distribution of pseudotachylytes, volume of fault rock materials, and microfracture sealing characteristics. The c. 100 m wide central zone is bound by two thick (\textasciitilde 2 m) and laterally continuous ({$>$}1 km) protocataclastic to ultracataclastic horizons. Within and immediately surrounding the central zone, fracture density is relatively high due to cataclastic fault\textendash fracture networks that reworked earlier-formed pseudotachylytes. The fault\textendash fracture networks were associated with pervasive microcracking and fluid\textendash rock interaction, resulting in the development of a c. 200 m thick alteration zone delimited by lobate fluid infiltration fronts. In the c. 250 m thick southern and northern zones, fracture densities are much lower and pseudotachylytes systematically overprint cataclastic faults that exploited pre-existing magmatic cooling joints. Analysis of the structure of the GLFZ suggests that it shares certain characteristics with the seismogenic source responsible for the 2002 Au Sable Forks intraplate earthquake sequence in the northeastern USA, including seismicity distributed across a fault zone 500\textendash 1000 m thick and large ({$>$}100 MPa) static stress drops associated with frictional melting.},

The existence of super-convergence is relevant to understanding why deep networks generalize well. One of the key elements of super-convergence is training with one learning rate cycle and a large maximum learning rate. A primary insight that allows super-convergence training is that large learning rates regularize the training, hence requiring a reduction of all other forms of regularization in order to preserve an optimal regularization balance. We also derive a simplification of the Hessian Free optimization method to compute an estimate of the optimal learning rate. Experiments demonstrate super-convergence for Cifar-10/100, MNIST and Imagenet datasets, and resnet, wide-resnet, densenet, and inception architectures. In addition, we show that super-convergence provides a greater boost in performance relative to standard training when the amount of labeled training data is limited.

We maintain computational tractability and limit memory requirements even for high dimensional optimization problems by storing and manipulating these quadratic approximations in a shared, time evolving, low dimensional subspace. Each update step requires only a single contributing function or minibatch evaluation (as in SGD), and each step is scaled using an approximate inverse Hessian and little to no adjustment of hyperparameters is required (as is typical for quasi-Newton methods). This algorithm contrasts with earlier stochastic second order techniques that treat the Hessian of each contributing function as a noisy approximation to the full Hessian, rather than as a target for direct estimation. We experimentally demonstrate improved convergence on seven diverse optimization problems. The algorithm is released as open source Python and MATLAB packages.},

ARC is a {$\sim$} 200 - 250 MWe tokamak reactor with a major radius of 3.3 m, a minor radius of 1.1 m, and an on-axis magnetic field of 9.2 T. ARC has rare earth barium copper oxide (REBCO) superconducting toroidal field coils, which have joints to enable disassembly. This allows the vacuum vessel to be replaced quickly, mitigating first wall survivability concerns, and permits a single device to test many vacuum vessel designs and divertor materials. The design point has a plasma fusion gain of Qp {$\approx$} 13.6, yet is fully non-inductive, with a modest bootstrap fraction of only {$\sim$}63\%. Thus ARC offers a high power gain with relatively large external control of the current profile. This highly attractive combination is enabled by the {$\sim$}23 T peak field on coil achievable with newly available REBCO superconductor technology. External current drive is provided by two innovative inboard RF launchers using 25 MW of lower hybrid and 13.6 MW of ion cyclotron fast wave power. The resulting efficient current drive provides a robust, steady state core plasma far from disruptive limits. ARC uses an all-liquid blanket, consisting of low pressure, slowly flowing fluorine lithium beryllium (FLiBe) molten salt. The liquid blanket is low-risk technology and provides effective neutron moderation and shielding, excellent heat removal, and a tritium breeding ratio {$\geq$} 1.1. The large temperature range over which FLiBe is liquid permits an output blanket temperature of 900 K, single phase fluid cooling, and a high efficiency helium Brayton cycle, which allows for net electricity generation when operating ARC as a Pilot power plant.},

Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces are computed with the `tree' method while long-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different time-steps. Individual and adaptive short-range time-steps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the parallelization algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological N-body simulation with more than 1010 dark matter particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 105 per dimension in a three-dimensional box. It has also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million. We present the algorithms used by the code and discuss their accuracy and performance using a number of test problems. GADGET-2 is publicly released to the research community.},

We actively control the pressure of injected fluids using a negative-feedback control system. Our analysis is based on the spring-slider model for modeling the earthquake instability. We use a general Coulomb-type rheology for describing the frictional behavior of a fault system. This model leads to a nonautonomous system, whose steady state and stability are studied using a double-scale asymptotic analysis. This approach renders the dominant order of the system time invariant. Established tools from the classical mathematical theory of control are used for designing a proper stabilizing controller. We show that the system is stabilizable by controlling fluid pressure. This is a central result for industrial operations. A stabilizing controller is then designed and tested. The controller regulates in real time the applied pressure in order to assure stability, avoid unwanted seismicity, and drive the system from unstable states of high potential energy, to stable ones of low energy. The controller performs well even in the absence of complete knowledge of the frictional properties of the system. Finally, we present two numerical examples (scenarios) and illustrate how anthropogenic and natural earthquakes could be, in theory, prevented.},

For practically relevant problem sizes, classical one-level methods had already reached their limits and new hierarchical algorithms had to be developed in order to allow an e cient solution of even larger problems. This paper gives a review of the \"yrst hierarchical and purely matrix-based approach, algebraic multigrid (AMG). AMG can directly be applied, for instance, to e ciently solve various types of elliptic partial di erential equations discretized on unstructured meshes, both in 2D and 3D. Since AMG does not make use of any geometric information, it is a ``plug-in'' solver which can even be applied to problems without any geometric background, provided that the underlying matrix has certain properties. c 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Though it is widely recognized that large mountain ranges produce significant stresses in the Earth's crust, these stresses are not commonly quantified. Nonetheless, near large mountains topography may affect fault activity by changing the stress balance on the faults. In this work, we calculate the stress field from topography in the Longmen Shan (Sichuan, China) and resolve those stresses on several models of the faults that ruptured in the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake. We find that the topography results in shear stresses up to 20 MPa and normal stresses up to 80 MPa on the faults, with significant variability across the faults. Topographic stresses generally load the fault in a normal and left-lateral shear sense, opposite to the inferred coseismic slip sense, and thus inhibit the coseismic slip. We estimate the tectonic stress needed to overcome topographic and lithostatic stresses by assuming that the direction of maximum shear accumulated on the faults is roughly collinear with the inferred coseismic slip. We further estimate the static friction and pore fluid pressure assuming that the fault was, on average, at Mohr-Coulomb failure at the time of the Wenchuan earthquake. We use a Bayesian inversion strategy, yielding posterior probability distributions for the estimated parameters. We find most likely estimates of maximum tectonic compressive stress near 0.6 \dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend gz and oriented {$\sim$}E-W, and minimum tectonic stress near 0.2 \dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend gz. Static friction on the fault is near 0.2, and pore fluid pressure is between 0 and 0.4 of the total pressure.},

Fixed-size scalability and isogranular analysis of the algorithms using an MPI-based parallel implementation was performed on a variety of input data and demonstrated good scalability for different processor counts (1 to 1024 processors) on the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center's TCS-1 AlphaServer. The results are consistent for different data distributions. Octrees with over a billion octants were constructed and balanced in less than a minute on 1024 processors. Like other existing algorithms for constructing and balancing octrees, our algorithms have \textvartheta{} (N log N) work and \textvartheta{} (N) storage complexity. Under reasonable assumptions on the distribution of octants and the work per octant, the parallel time complexity is \textvartheta{} (N/np log np log(N/np) + np log np), where N is the size of the final linear octree and np is the number of processors.},

In contrast to standard heuristic formulations, we learn a statistical model of both brightness constancy error and the spatial properties of optical flow using image sequences with associated ground truth flow fields. The result is a complete probabilistic model of optical flow. Specifically, the ground truth enables us to model how the assumption of brightness constancy is violated in naturalistic sequences, resulting in a probabilistic model of ``brightness inconstancy''. We also generalize previous high-order constancy assumptions, such as gradient constancy, by modeling the constancy of responses to various linear filters in a high-order random field framework. These filters are free variables that can be learned from training data. Additionally we study the spatial structure of the optical flow and how motion boundaries are related to image intensity boundaries. Spatial smoothness is modeled using a Steerable Random Field, where spatial derivatives of the optical flow are steered by the image brightness structure. These models provide a statistical motivation for previous methods and enable the learning of all parameters from training data. All proposed models are quantitatively compared on the Middlebury flow dataset.},

The typical formulation, however, has changed little since the work of Horn and Schunck. We attempt to uncover what has made recent advances possible through a thorough analysis of how the objective function, the optimization method, and modern implementation practices influence accuracy. We discover that ``classical'' flow formulations perform surprisingly well when combined with modern optimization and implementation techniques. Moreover, we find that while median filtering of intermediate flow fields during optimization is a key to recent performance gains, it leads to higher energy solutions. To understand the principles behind this phenomenon, we derive a new objective that formalizes the median filtering heuristic. This objective includes a nonlocal term that robustly integrates flow estimates over large spatial neighborhoods. By modifying this new term to include information about flow and image boundaries we develop a method that ranks at the top of the Middlebury benchmark.},

A lot of work on solving optimization problems or improving optimization methods in machine learning has been proposed successively. The systematic retrospect and summary of the optimization methods from the perspective of machine learning are of great significance, which can offer guidance for both developments of optimization and machine learning research. In this paper, we first describe the optimization problems in machine learning. Then, we introduce the principles and progresses of commonly used optimization methods.

Here we show that the strengths of active thrust-belt wedges and their basal detachments can be directly determined from the covariation of surface slope {$\alpha$} with detachment dip {$\beta$}, without strong assumptions about the specific strength-controlling mechanisms. Even a single taper measurement ({$\alpha$}, {$\beta$}) can strongly constrain the set of possible wedge and detachment strengths. This theory is tested with dry sand wedges and then applied to the Niger delta thrust belt, the active Taiwan mountain belt, and the thrust that slipped in the M = 7.6 Chi-Chi earthquake. Their basal detachments are shown to be exceedingly weak, with effective coefficients of friction (0.04\textendash 0.1) that are an order of magnitude less than most laboratory friction coefficients (0.6\textendash 0.85). In contrast, these wedges are moderately strong internally, within the range of pressure-dependent strengths in deep boreholes. These results confirm the existence of exceedingly weak faults and strong crust, which raises important causal questions.},

Although DNNs work well whenever large labeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences to sequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence learning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT'14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous best result on this task. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier.},

The parallel scheme is based on a greedy coloring algorithm, where two nodes in the hierarchy with the same color are separated by at least {$\sigma$} nodes. We proved that when {$\sigma$} {$\geq$} 6, the workload associated with one color is embarrassingly parallel. However, the number of nodes in a group (color) may be small when {$\sigma$} = 6. Therefore, we also explored {$\sigma$} = 3, where a small fraction of the algorithm needs to be serialized, and the overall parallel efficiency was improved. We implemented the parallel IFMM using OpenMP for shared-memory machines. Successively, we applied it to a fast-multipole accelerated boundary element method (FMBEM) as a preconditioner, and compared its efficiency with (a) the original IFMM parallelized by linking a multi-threaded linear algebra library and (b) the commonly used parallel block-diagonal preconditioner. Our results showed that our parallel IFMM achieved at most 4\texttimes{} and 11\texttimes{} speedups over the reference method (a) and (b), respectively, in realistic examples involving more than one million variables.},

  abstract = {This review article deals with the regularization of the boundary element formulations for solution of boundary value problems of continuum mechanics. These formulations may be singular owing to the use of two-point singular fundamental solutions. When the physical interpretation is irrelevant for this topic of computational mechanics, we consider various mechanical problems simultaneously within particular sections selected according to the main topic. In spite of such a structure of the paper, applications of the regularization techniques to many mechanical problems are described. There are distinguished two main groups of regularization techniques according to their application to singular formulations either before or after the discretization. Further subclassification of each group is made with respect to basic principles employed in individual regularization techniques. This paper summarizes the substances of the regularization procedures which are illustrated on the boundary element formulation for a scalar potential field. We discuss the regularizations of both the strongly singular and hypersingular integrals, occurring in the boundary integral equations, as well as those of nearly singular and nearly hypersingular integrals arising when the source point is near the integration element (as compared to its size) but not on this element. The possible dimensional inconsistency (or scale dependence of results) of the regularization after discretization is pointed out. Finally, we discuss the numerical approximations in various boundary element formulations, as well as the implementations of solutions of some problems for which derivative boundary integral equations are required.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a class of high resolution local time step schemes for nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws and the closely related convection-diffusion equations, by projecting the solution increments of the underlying partial differential equations (PDE) at each local time step. The main advantages are that they are of good consistency, and it is convenient to implement them. The schemes are L\textdegree\textdegree{} stable, satisfy a cell entropy inequality, and may be extended to the initial boundary value problem of general unsteady PDEs with higher-order spatial derivatives. The high resolution schemes are given by combining the reconstruction technique with a second order TVD Runge-Kutta scheme or a Laj\{-Wendroff type method, respectively. The schemes are used to solve a linear convection-diffusion equation, the nonlinear inviscid Burgers' equation, the one- and two-dimensional compressible Euler equations, and the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The numerical results show that the schemes are of higher-order accuracy, and efficient in saving computational cost, especially, for the case of combining the present schemes with the adaptive mesh method [15]. The correct locations of the slow moving or stronger discontinuities are also obtained, although the schemes are slightly nonconservative.\vphantom\}},

Their potential usefulness in a parallel environment has motivated much interest in recent years. However, the capability of an approximate inverse in eliminating the local error has not yet been fully exploited in multigrid algorithms. A careful examination of the iteration matrices of these approximate inverses indicates their superiority in smoothing the high-frequency error in addition to their inherent parallelism. We propose a new class of SAI smoothers in this paper and present their analytic smoothing factors for constant coefficient PDEs. The following are several distinctive features that make this technique special: \textbullet{} By adjusting the quality of the approximate inverse, the smoothing factor can be improved accordingly. For hard problems, this is useful. \textbullet{} In contrast to the ordering sensitivity of other smoothing techniques, this technique is ordering independent. \textbullet{} In general, the sequential performance of many superior parallel algorithms is not very competitive. This technique is useful in both parallel and sequential computations. Our theoretical and numerical results have demonstrated the effectiveness of this new technique.},

Based on the poroelastic theory, we employ three-dimensional finite element models to simulate the evolution of stress and pore pressure due to reservoir impoundment, and its effect on the Coulomb failure stress on the LSF. The results indicate that the reservoir impoundment formed a pore pressure front that slowly propagated through the crust with fluid diffusion. The reservoir loading induced either moderate or no increase of the Coulomb failure stress at the hypocenter prior to the WE. The Coulomb failure stress, however, grew \textasciitilde 9.3\textendash 69.1 kPa in the depth range of 1\textendash 8 km on the LSF, which may have advanced tectonic loading of the fault system by \textasciitilde 60\textendash 450 years. Due to uncertainties of fault geometry and hypocenter location of the WE, it is inconclusive whether impoundment of the ZR directly triggered the WE. However, a small event at the hypocenter could have triggered large rupture elsewhere on fault, where the asperities were weakened by the ZR. The microseismicity around the ZR also showed an expanding pattern from the ZR since its impoundment, likely associated with diffusion of a positive pore pressure pulse. These results suggest a poroelastic triggering effect (even if indirectly) of the WE due to the impoundment of the ZR.},

Central to our approach is a probabilistic representation of the motion flow that is computed using only local evidence and without resorting to global optimization. To estimate the flow in image regions where the motion is smooth, we use a sparse set of samples only, thereby avoiding the expensive computation inherent in traditional dense algorithms. We show that our results can be used as is for a variety of video editing tasks. For applications where accuracy is paramount, we use our result to bootstrap a global optimization. This significantly reduces the running times of such methods without sacrificing accuracy. We also demonstrate that the SimpleFlow algorithm can process HD and 4K footage in reasonable times.},

  abstract = {As several modeling studies indicate, the structural expression and dynamic behavior of orogenic mountain belts are dictated not only by their rheological properties or by far-field tectonic motion, but also by the efficiency of erosion and sedimentation acting on its surface. Until recently, numerical investigations have been mainly limited to 2-D studies because of the high computational cost required by 3-D models. Here, we have efficiently coupled the landscape evolution model Cascade with the 3-D thermomechanically coupled tectonics code FANTOM. Details of the coupling algorithms between both codes are given. We present results of numerical experiments designed to study the response of viscous-plastic crustal materials subjected to convergence and to surface processes including both erosion and sedimentation. In particular, we focus on the equilibration of both the tectonic structures and on the surface morphology of the orogen. We show that increasing the efficiency of fluvial erosion increases the frontal thrust angle, which in turn decreases the width of the orogen. In addition, the maximum summit elevation of the orogen during transient evolution is significantly higher in those models showcasing surface processes than those that do not. This illustrates the strong coupling between tectonics and surface processes. We also demonstrate that an along-strike gradient of erosion efficiency can have a major impact upon the landscape morphology and the tectonic structure and deformation of the orogen, in both the across-strike and alongstrike directions. Overall, our results suggest that surface processes, by enhancing localization of deformation, can act as a positive forcing to topographic building.},

  abstract = {Physics-based numerical simulations of earthquakes and slow slip, coupled with field observations and laboratory experiments, can, in principle, be used to determine fault properties and potential fault behaviors. Because of the computational cost of simulating inertial wave-mediated effects, their representation is often simplified. The quasi-dynamic (QD) approach approximately accounts for inertial effects through a radiation damping term. We compare QD and fully dynamic (FD) simulations by exploring the long-term behavior of rate-and-state fault models with and without additional weakening during seismic slip. The models incorporate a velocity-strengthening (VS) patch in a velocity-weakening (VW) zone, to consider rupture interaction with a slip-inhibiting heterogeneity. Without additional weakening, the QD and FD approaches generate qualitatively similar slip patterns with quantitative differences, such as slower slip velocities and rupture speeds during earthquakes and more propensity for rupture arrest at the VS patch in the QD cases. Simulations with additional coseismic weakening produce qualitatively different patterns of earthquakes, with near-periodic pulse-like events in the FD simulations and much larger crack-like events accompanied by smaller events in the QD simulations. This is because the FD simulations with additional weakening allow earthquake rupture to propagate at a much lower level of prestress than the QD simulations. The resulting much larger ruptures in the QD simulations are more likely to propagate through the VS patch, unlike for the cases with no additional weakening. Overall, the QD approach should be used with caution, as the QD simulation results could drastically differ from the true response of the physical model considered.},

It enables us to treat scattering problems from electrically large faceted bodies in a numerically rigorous and computationally efficient manner, in terms of both time and memory. The analytically derived characteristic basis functions include certain desirable features of the asymptotic schemes and are defined on subdomains that can be electrically large, not being bound to the typical discretization size of the conventional method of moments. By properly weighting through a Galerkin procedure the resulting electric field integral equation, the problem is reduced to a matrix equation having dimensions that do not depend on the size of the scatterer but only on its shape. Electrically large problems can be handled in a computationally efficient manner by using the proposed method since the associated matrix size is relatively small; moreover, all the reduced matrix elements are calculated in the spectral domain without evaluating any convolution products.},

  abstract = {Geologic observations indicate that faults are fractally rough surfaces, with deviations from planarity at all length scales. Fault roughness introduces complexity in the rupture process and resulting ground motion. We present a 2D kinematic rupture generator that emulates the strong dependence of earthquake source parameters on local fault geometry observed in dynamic models of ruptures on nonplanar faults. This pseudodynamic model is based on a statistical analysis of ensembles of 2D plane strain rupture simulations on fractally rough faults with rate-weakening friction and off-fault viscoplasticity. We observe strong anticorrelation of roughness-induced fluctuations in final slip, rupture velocity, and peak slip velocity with the local fault slope for rightlateral strike-slip ruptures. Spatial variability in these source parameters excites highfrequency seismic waves that are consistent with observed strong-motion records. Although accurate modeling of this high-frequency motion is critical to seismic-hazard analysis, dynamic rupture simulations are currently too computationally inefficient to be of practical use in such applications. We find that the seismic waves excited by the pseudodynamic model have similar intensity and spectral content to the corresponding dynamic model. Although the method has been developed in 2D, we envision that a similar approach could be taken for the 3D problem, provided that computational resources are available to generate an ensemble set of 3D dynamic rupture simulations. The resulting methodology is expected to find future application in efficient earthquake simulations that accurately quantify high-frequency ground motion.},

Both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions can be treated. The current ghost cell treatment is both suitable for staggered and non-staggered Cartesian grids. The accuracy of the current method is validated using flow past a circular cylinder and large eddy simulation of turbulent flow over a wavy surface. Numerical results are compared with experimental data and boundary-fitted grid results. The method is further extended to an existing ocean model (MITGCM) to simulate geophysical flow over a three-dimensional bump. The method is easily implemented as evidenced by our use of several existing codes.},

In satellite images, the Piqiang Fault appears as a sharp, NW-trending lineament that can be traced for more than 70 km. It is oblique to the general structural trend of the thrust belt and subparallel to the thrust transport direction. This paper presents a structural analysis of the Piqiang Fault, based on satellite image interpretation and field data. A net loss of Late Paleozoic sediment across the fault zone implies that it was initiated as a major normal fault during the Early Permian, and corresponds to widespread extension and magmatism during this period. Differential erosion across the fault resulted in the subsequent removal of sediment from the east relative to the west. During the Middle to Late Cenozoic, contraction of the NW Tarim Basin and the formation of the Keping Shan Thrust Belt resulted in reactivation of the Piqiang Fault as a strike-slip (tear) fault. The fault has accommodated lateral differences in thrust density and spacing which have arisen due to the abrupt, pre-existing change in stratigraphic thickness across it. The Piqiang Fault provides an insight into the formation of oblique, strike-slip (tear) faults in contractional belts and demonstrates the importance of inherited basement structures in such settings.},

Normal faults of the Sierra Nevada frontal fault system strike ϳ45؇ clockwise of the small circle trajectories and exhibit well-defined, left-stepping en echelon patterns, consistent with formation in dextral transcurrent regime. Major graben bordering the northeastern Sierran microplate are located in regions where the locus of rangefront deformation steps abruptly eastward in a releasing geometry relative to Sierra Nevada\textendash North American motion. Crustal shortening occurs at the northern end of the Sierran microplate, where a component of northwest dextral shear steps westward in a leftrestraining geometry across the Sierran crest to the Sacramento Valley. Kinematic inversions of earthquake focal mechanisms from the Walker Lane belt bordering the eastern Sierra Nevada indicate that seismogenic deformation primarily is characterized by horizontal shearing and oblique crustal thinning. Directions of macroscopic dextral shear inferred from the inversions are subparallel to the trajectories of small circles about the Sierra Nevada\textendash North American Euler pole.

The most urgent countermeasure consists of two key elements. One is strengthening of weak structures and the other is short-term earthquake prediction. Short-term prediction needs precursors. Although some promising precursors are reported, the prevailing views in Japan and elsewhere are overly pessimistic. The pessimism largely roots in the fact that short-term precursors are generally non-seismic and tools developed for seismology are not designed to detect them. Nonetheless, nationally funded large-scale earthquake prediction programs always emphasize the need to reinforce seismometer networks. They do not take into account the views of those in the science community who point to the importance of non-seismic precursors. While there are well-founded causes to be skeptical, the situation needs to be improved. One reason for skepticism is that the observations of precursors have not yet been perfect enough and another is that some important fundamental aspects of non-seismic precursors are still unresolved. We review some of these problems.},

To this end, we carried out a palaeomagnetic study in the NE Gobi Altai of southern Mongolia, sampling widely exposed lower Cretaceous lavas allowing comparison of rotation histories of the Ih Bogd, Baga Bogd and Artz Bogd restraining bends at the eastern termination of the Bogd strike-slip zone. We provide new 40Ar/39Ar ages to show that the stratigraphy of mafic lavas and fluvio-lacustrine sediments on the southern flanks of Mt Ih Bogd and Mt Baga Bogd have ages between {$\sim$}125 and {$\sim$}122 Ma, and a mafic sill that intrudes the sequence has an age of 118.2 {$\pm$} 0.8 Ma. The lavas are older than previously dated lavas south of Artz Bogd, with ages of 119\textendash 115 Ma. Palaeomagnetic results from the 119\textendash 115 Ma lavas south of Artz Bogd show a significant steeper inclination than both results from 125 to 122 Ma lavas of Baga Bogd and Ih Bogd, as well as from newly sampled and previously published younger lavas and necks of the 107\textendash 92 Ma Tsost Magmatic Field and Shovon and Khurmen Uul basalts. We explain this result by insufficient averaging of secular variation and small errors induced by overcorrection of bedding tilt. We show that individual lavas in the SE Artz Bogd locality represent individual spot readings of the Earth's magnetic field and integrate all results obtained from lower Cretaceous lavas in the Gobi Altai. We present a pole, or rather, an apparent polar wander path without significant plate motion from the reference positions of Eurasia, from {$\sim$}125 to 95 Ma, with n = 126, {$\lambda$} = 80.8{$\smwhtcircle$}, {$\varphi$} = 158.4{$\smwhtcircle$}, {$\kappa$} = 25.3, A95 = 2.5, palaeolatitude = 48.2 with a scatter S{$\lambda$} = 16.7 (Sl = 15.3, Su = 17.8) and a regionally consistent direction for the Gobi Altai of D/I = 11.1{$\smwhtcircle$}/65.9{$\smwhtcircle$}, D/ I = 3.8{$\smwhtcircle$}/1.9{$\smwhtcircle$}. This is one of the best-determined palaeopoles/APWP's for Asia. Formation of the Ih Bogd, Baga Bogd and Artz Bogd restraining bends was thus not associated with vertical axis rotations larger than our error margin of {$\sim$}10{$\smwhtcircle$}. From this we conclude that the Bogd strike-slip zone is a weak fault zone, in which shear is localized.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a second order optimization method to learn models where both the dimensionality of the parameter space and the number of training samples is high. In our method, we construct on each iteration a Krylov subspace formed by the gradient and an approximation to the Hessian matrix, and then use a subset of the training data samples to optimize over this subspace. As with the Hessian Free (HF) method of Martens (2010), the Hessian matrix is never explicitly constructed, and is computed using a subset of data. In practice, as in HF, we typically use a positive definite substitute for the Hessian matrix such as the Gauss-Newton matrix. We investigate the effectiveness of our proposed method on deep neural networks, and compare its performance to widely used methods such as stochastic gradient descent, conjugate gradient descent and L-BFGS, and also to HF. Our method leads to faster convergence than either L-BFGS or HF, and generally performs better than either of them in cross-validation accuracy. It is also simpler and more general than HF, as it does not require a positive semidefinite approximation of the Hessian matrix to work well nor the setting of a damping parameter. The chief drawback versus HF is the need for memory to store a basis for the Krylov subspace.},

Our study, moreover, shows that for each of the magnetic anomalies studied, a combination exists of total reconstruction poles for the different plates and plate fragments such that the modeled shortening values in the Pyrenees are in good agreement with the shortening values inferred from partially restored sections of the balanced ECORS Pyrenees profile. At the same time, the magnitude of the belt-averaged shear, i.e., the strike-slip component divided by the normal shortening, is predicted to be smaller than implicit in previous plate-kinematic studies, which seems consistent with the generally recognized thrust-belt nature of the Pyrenees.},

Recent work towards coupling of a Fast Multipole Method (FMM) to QBX yielded a first step towards the rapid evaluation of such integrals (and the solution of related integral equations), albeit with only empirically understood error behavior. In this paper, we improve upon this approach with a modified algorithm for which we give a comprehensive analysis of error and cost in the case of the Laplace equation in two dimensions. For the same levels of (user-specified) accuracy, the new algorithm empirically has cost-per-accuracy comparable to prior approaches.

GIGAQBX is a fast high-order scheme for evaluation of layer potentials based on Quadrature by Expansion (`QBX') using local expansions formed via the Fast Multipole Method (FMM). Target-specific expansions serve to lower the cost of the formation and evaluation of QBX local expansions, reducing the associated computational effort from \$O((p+1)\^\{2\})\$ to \$O(p+1)\$ in three dimensions, without any accuracy loss compared with conventional expansions, but with the loss of source/target separation in the expansion coefficients. GIGAQBX is a `global' QBX scheme, meaning that the potential is mediated entirely through expansions for points close to or on the boundary. In our scheme, this single global expansion is decomposed into two parts that are evaluated separately: one part incorporating near-field contributions using target-specific expansions, and one part using conventional spherical harmonic expansions of far-field contributions, noting that convergence guarantees only exist for the sum of the two sub-expansions. By contrast, target-specific expansions were originally introduced as an acceleration mechanism for `local' QBX schemes, in which the far-field does not contribute to the QBX expansion. Compared with the unmodified GIGAQBX algorithm, we show through a reproducible, time-calibrated cost model that the combined scheme yields a considerable cost reduction for the near-field evaluation part of the computation. We support the effectiveness of our scheme through numerical results demonstrating performance improvements for Laplace and Helmholtz kernels.},

  abstract = {Surveys of shear strain rates derived from repeated triangulation cover about one-quarter of the area of the plate boundary zone through New Zealand and are well distributed within it. Using a method developed by Haines relating shear strains to the total strain and velocity fields, the dilatatidnal and rotational strain rates and the velocities within the deformed zone are derived. The plate boundary zone is shown to be two-dimensional, for the most part, in that gradients of the velocity along the length of the zone are small or zero. The shear strain rates are not uniform, however; they Teach a maximum along a central axis and decrease gradually to zero toward the sides. Nor are the two independent components of strain, one involving shortening (or extension) perpendicular, and the other shear parallel, to the zone equally developed everywhere; there is a clear geographic separation with shortening developed over the subduction thrust and shear developed behind in a zone of wrench faulting. Time variations in the strain field in part of the region above the subduction interface are related to changes in the degree of coupling across the interface. A velocity field is computed: the relative velocity of the two plates from this data agree very well with that derived from seafloor spreading data. These strain and velocity fields derived from geodetic studies give the short-term kinematics of the plate boundary zone. The long-term kinematics of the zone are estimated from: (1) uplift and subsidence data which are related to changes in crustal thickness and hence to dilatational strain, and (2) variation in the declination of primary magnetization in rocks of known age, related to the rotational strain. The rate of rotational strain has increased in time from about 2 to 3"Myr-', 10Myr ago, to about 9" Myr-' today. The increase can be understood as a secondary effect of a developing compressional component increasing the coupling between the plates so that more of the motion parallel to the zone is accommodated by distributed shear and less by aseismic slip. The rates of strain averaged over the last 1 Myr or so, and at a scale length of a few tens *Present address: Department of Earth Sciences, University of Cambridge, Downing Street, Cambridge CB2 3EQ.},

  abstract = {We have determined a source rupture model for the 1992 Landers earthquake (Mw 7.2) compatible with multiple data sets, spanning a frequency range from zero to 0.5 Hz. Geodetic survey displacements, near-field and regional strong motions, broadband teleseismic waveforms, and surface offset measurements have been used explicitly to constrain both the spatial and temporal slip variations along the model fault surface. Our fault parameterization involves a variable-slip, multiple-segment, finite-fault model which treats the diverse data sets in a self-consistent manner, allowing them to be inverted both independently and in unison. The high-quality data available for the Landers earthquake provide an unprecedented opportunity for direct comparison of rupture models determined from independent data sets that sample both a wide frequency range and a diverse spatial station orientation with respect to the earthquake slip and radiation pattern. In all models, consistent features include the following: (1) similar overall dislocation patterns and amplitudes with seismic moments of 7 to 8 x 1026 dyne-cm (seismic potency of 2.3 to 2.7 km3); (2) very heterogeneous, unilateral strike slip distributed over a fault length of 65 km and over a width of at least 15 kin, though slip is limited to shallower regions in some areas; (3) a total rupture duration of 24 sec and an average rupture velocity of 2.7 km/sec; and (4) substantial variations of slip with depth relative to measured surface offsets. The extended rupture length and duration of the Landers earthquake also allowed imaging of the propagating rupture front with better resolution than for those of prior shorter-duration, strike-slip events. Our imaging allows visualization of the rupture evolution, including local differences in slip durations and variations in rupture velocity. Rupture velocity decreases markedly at shallow depths, as well as near regions of slip transfer from one fault segment to the next, as rupture propagates northwestward along the multiply segmented fault length. The rupture front slows as it reaches the northern limit of the Johnson Valley/Landers faults where slip is transferred to the southern Homestead Valley fault; an abrupt acceleration is apparent following the transfer. This process is repeated, and is more pronounced, as slip is again passed from the northern Homestead Valley fault to the Emerson fault. Although the largest surface offsets were observed at the northern end of the rupture, our modeling indicates that substantial rupture was also relatively shallow (less than 10 kin) in this region.},

The strikeslip faults of central Mongolia constitute a previously unrecognized hazard in this part of Mongolia. Each of the strike-slip faults show indications of late Quaternary activity in the form of aligned sequences of sag-ponds and pressure-ridges developed in alluvial deposits. Total bed-rock displacements of {$\sim$}3 km are measured on both the Songino-Margats and South Hangay fault systems. Bed-rock displacements of 11 km are observed across the Hag Nuur fault. Cumulative offset across the Uliastay fault systems are unknown but are unlikely to be large. We have no quantitative constraint on the age of faulting in the Hangay. The {$\leq$}20 km of cumulative slip on the Hangay faults might, at least in part, be inherited from earlier tectonic movements. Our observations show that, despite the almost complete absence of instrumentally recorded seismicity in the Hangay, this part of Mongolia is cut through by numerous distributed strike-slip faults that accommodate regional left-lateral shear between Siberia and China. Central Mongolia is thus an important component of the India\textendash Eurasia collision that would be overlooked in models of the active tectonics based on the distribution of seismicity. We suggest that active faults such as those identified in the Hangay of Mongolia might exist in other, apparently aseismic, regions within continental collision zones.},

  abstract = {We describe the late Cenozoic structure and evolution of the Jid right-lateral strike-slip fault in the northern Mongolian Altay mountain chain. Parts of the Jid fault have a vertical component of motion, introduced by bending along the fault. Some locations show additional structural complexity at the Earth's surface, with parallel strands having strike-slip, normal and reverse faulting, probably indicating a spatial separation of dip-slip and strike-slip components of motion in cross-section. The Jid fault shows indications of recent movements at scales ranging from drainage re-organisation at the kilometre scale, to ground deformations likely to result from movements during the last earthquake, which occurred w870e980 years ago based on OSL dating of deposits exposed in trenching. From the scale of the ruptures the earthquake would have had a magnitude of w7.5 with an estimated right-lateral slip of w5 m. Numerous horizontal offsets of about 10e15 m, and vertical scarps of w5 m in the youngest alluvial deposits show the likely cumulative movement over the last w15,000 years, and suggest a maximum slip-rate of roughly 1 mm/yr. The minimum cumulative right-lateral slip on the Jid fault is 1 km, which would accumulate in w1 Ma at present-day rates of slip. The relatively small vertical component of motion on the Jid fault is not sufficient to generate topography in the adjacent Kharkhiraa and Tu\textasciidieresis rgen Uul mountains, with relief of over 2000 m. The high mountains may therefore result from localised uplift on thrust faults rather than by oblique slip on the Jid fault.},

  abstract = {New geochronologic data from the Clark Mountain area, eastern California, better define the regional development of the Cordilleran magmatic arc and the timing of hinterland and foreland deformation at this latitude. The new ages show that Sevier belt thrusting started in the Clark Mountain thrust complex in Late Jurassic time. This is consistent with other studies that suggest a similar age of initiation of the Sevier belt in areas to the north. The Clark Mountain thrust complex is located at the intersection of the Mesozoic magmatic arc and the east Sierran and Sevier thrust belts. New U-Pb zircon ages for granitic rocks establish the timing of deformation within the thrust complex. The Pachalka thrust, structurally the highest fault in the complex, carries plutonic rocks eastward above Cambrian rocks. Hanging-wall and footwall rocks are mylonitic near the thrust. Hanging-wall plutonic rocks, previously considered Precambrian, are dated at 146 ؎ 2 Ma and thus are Late Jurassic. Folds kinematically related to thrusting in footwall metasedimentary rocks are overturned eastward and cut by the Pachalka pluton dated at 142 ؎ 7 Ma. This brackets thrusting and related deformation in structurally high levels of the complex to be latest Jurassic. The Ivanpah and Striped Mountain plutons in the Ivanpah Mountains have been dated at 147 ؎ 7 Ma and 141 ؎ 11 Ma, respectively. These plutons are cut by the Keaney-Mollusk Mine and Morning Star Mine thrusts, which are in turn cut by the middle to late Cretaceous Teutonia batholith. These data indicate that these thrusts are early to middle Cretaceous in age.},

  abstract = {Thrust and reverse faults pose significant earthquake hazards in convergent plate margins around the world, but have proven difficult to study given the complex nature of their ruptures, which often involve multiple along-strike and vertically stacked fault segments. The 2013 Mw 6.6 Lushan earthquake exemplified this complexity, rupturing a blind thrust fault in the southern Longmen Shan, which border the western Sichuan Basin in China. This event occurred 80 km south of the epicenter of the destructive 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake. The Wenchuan earthquake produced surface ruptures on two parallel fault splays, the Pengguan and Beichuan faults. In contrast, the Lushan earthquake was generated by a ramp in the Range Front blind thrust (RFBT), which is in the footwall of the Wenchuan rupture. We use seismic reflection profiles, petroleum wells, and relocated seismicity to construct a threedimensional model of this imbricated fault system. Our model illustrates that the 2013 Lushan earthquake ruptured {$<$}10\% of the RFBT, which extends for 250 km along the Longmen Shan range front and into the western Sichuan Basin. Analysis of growth strata in structures above the RFBT fault along strike shows clear evidence of Quaternary activity and constrains the middle Pleistocene to current slip rate at two locations on the fault. Single segment and multi\- segment fault rupture scenarios involving the RFBT suggest the potential for large earthquakes (M7.8) that would affect the densely populated western Sichuan Basin. Assessing the hazards posed by such complex thrust systems, which occur in convergent margins worldwide, requires subsurface characterization of fault segments that can be independently associated with geologic and seismologic evidence of fault activity.},

  abstract = {The devastating 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake, China, demonstrates that the central and northern parts of the Longmen Shan are currently active. Evidence for active faulting and folding in the southern Longmen Shan, however, remains poorly documented. In this paper, we define the structural geometry, fault kinematics, and seismic hazard of the Qiongxi thrust fault system (QTF) along the southern Longmen Shan range front by integrating deep and shallow seismic-reflection data and geomorphic observations. The QTF is a 50 km long, north\textendash south-trending set of faults and associated folds that exhibit geomorphic evidence of Quaternary surface deformation. Geomorphic observations and seismic-reflection data reveal that these faults dip steeply to the east and merge at depth with a blind, west-dipping thrust ramp. The trend and reverse sense of slip along the QTF indicates that the structure accommodates east\textendash west crustal shortening. Based on uplift of stratigraphic horizons across the fault zone, we define a Late Pliocene\textendash to\textendash Early Pleistocene fault slip rate of 0:2\textendash 0:3 mm=yr and a Middle Pleistocene\textendash to\textendash present rate of 0:4\textendash 1:2 mm=yr on the west-dipping thrust ramp. This ramp soles to a basal detachment in the Triassic section at a depth of 4.5\textendash 5.5 km. To the west, this detachment steps down onto a blind, northwest-dipping thrust termed the Range Front thrust. A rupture of the QTF in combination with the Range Front thrust could generate an Mw 7.8 earthquake with average displacement of 5.7 m. This type of earthquake source poses significant hazards to the adjacent, highly populated Sichuan basin.},

In the absenceof active back-arc spreading,the forearcmargin-normal stressis controlledmainly by the total shear forcealongthe subductionfault (or the plate couplingforce)andthe gravitational force. The plate couplingforce createscompression,and the gravitational force, in the presenceof margin topography,createslateral tension. We give a simple expressionthat relatesthe forearc stressto topographyand averagefault strength, with the latter representedby an effectivecoefficientof friction /\textbullet. We alsouse a finite element model of two convergingplates in frictional contact to model the forearc stresses.The analysesindicate that a low-stressforearc requiresnot only the subductionfault to be very weak but alsothe mechanically coupledfault area to be narrow in the downdip direction and shallowin depth. For Nankai and Cascadia, where the coupledfault areasare narrow and shallowbecauseof the young and hot subductingplates,/\textbullet{} is about 0.05 or lessand in \textbullet tnycaselessthan 0.09.

The penalty method requires the careful selection of a penalty parameter and may lead to an inexact imposition of the constraints. Elimination is preferable because it is exact. The zero rows that elimination generates in the coefficient matrix can be removed by reducing the order of the matrix, or by adding back the constraints. The latter approach has the advantage of keeping the imposition of constraints separate from matrix assembly. However, straightforward addition of multi-point constraint equations destroys the symmetry of the matrix. A new method of adding the constraints preserves matrix symmetry.},

  abstract = {Geologic maps have long portrayed the Late Cretaceous\textendash Recent geologic history of southeastern Mongolia as tectonically quiescent. We present new data based on outcrop observations that indicate the northeast-trending East Gobi fault zone (EGFZ) was reactivated in the Cenozoic as a sinistral strike-slip fault system. Inversions of Cenozoic fault-slip data imply that faulting was associated with north\textendash northwest subhorizontal shortening and east\textendash northeast subhorizontal extension. We propose that faulting is Tertiary in age based on published interpretations of seismic reflection data which reveal that the mid-Cretaceous (\textasciitilde 100\textendash 95 Ma) unconformity is deformed by strike-slip faults, and based on field observation of strike-slip faults and fracture sets that cut Upper Cretaceous and Cenozoic strata but lack evidence for neotectonic activity. Published seismicity maps also appear to argue against significant Quaternary faulting within the EGFZ. These new data may lend credence to published models proposing a Middle Miocene or older kinematic linkage between the EGFZ and the Altyn Tagh fault in China. The recognition that the EGFZ has a history of left-lateral displacement in both the Early Mesozoic and Cenozoic means that currently available estimates of offset based on displaced Paleozoic rocks constrain total offset only. This reactivation history supports the notion that inherited lithospheric structures are important in controlling the location and, thus, modes of intracontinental deformation in Asia as a function of collisional far field effects and evolving boundary conditions of the Pacific margin.},

@article{wellsNewEmpiricalRelationships,
  title = {New {{Empirical Relationships}} among {{Magnitude}}, {{Rupture Length}}, {{Rupture Width}}, {{Rupture Area}}, and {{Surface Displacement}}},
  author = {Wells, Donald L and Coppersmith, Kevin J},
  pages = {29},
  abstract = {Source parameters for historical earthquakes worldwide are compiled to develop a series of empirical relationships among moment magnitude (M), surface rupture length, subsurface rupture length, downdip rupture width, rupture area, and maximum and average displacement per event. The resulting data base is a significant update of previous compilations and includes the additional source parameters of seismic moment, moment magnitude, subsurface rupture length, downdip rupture width, and average surface displacement. Each source parameter is classified as reliable or unreliable, based on our evaluation of the accuracy of individual values. Only the reliable source parameters are used in the final analyses. In comparing source parameters, we note the following trends: (1) Generally, the length of rupture at the surface is equal to 75\% of the subsurface rupture length; however, the ratio of surface rupture length to subsurface rupture length increases with magnitude; (2) the average surface displacement per event is about one-half the maximum surface displacement per event; and (3) the average subsurface displacement on the fault plane is less than the maximum surface displacement but more than the average surface displacement. Thus, for most earthquakes in this data base, slip on the fault plane at seismogenic depths is manifested by similar displacements at the surface. Log-linear regressions between earthquake magnitude and surface rupture length, subsurface rupture length, and rupture area are especially well correlated, showing standard deviations of 0.25 to 0.35 magnitude units. Most relationships are not statistically different (at a 95\% significance level) as a function of the style of faulting: thus, we consider the regressions for all slip types to be appropriate for most applications. Regressions between magnitude and displacement, magnitude and rupture width, and between displacement and rupture length are less well correlated and have larger standard deviation than regressions between magnitude and length or area. The large number of data points in most of these regressions and their statistical stability suggest that they are unlikely to change significantly in response to additional data. Separating the data according to extensional and compressional tectonic environments neither provides statistically different results nor improves the statistical significance of the regressions. Regressions for cases in which earthquake magnitude is either the independent or the dependent parameter can be used to estimate maximum earthquake magnitudes both for surface faults and for subsurface seismic sources such as blind faults, and to estimate the expected surface displacement along a fault for a given size earthquake.},

As a complement to recent efforts to discover the interrelationships among climate, topography, erosion, and rock deformation under conditions of mass-flux steady state, we explore orogen response to changes in climate and tectonic influx. We derive an analytical model that predicts a powerful climatic control on orogen evolution and distinct, potentially diagnostic, responses to climatic and tectonic perturbations. Due to isostatic compensation, the near-surface rock uplift rate during transients is tightly coupled to climate-modulated erosional efficiency. System response is approximately exponential, with a characteristic response timescale that is inversely proportional to the climate- and lithology-modulated erosional efficiency, and is largely insensitive to initial conditions, tectonic influx, and both the sign and magnitude of perturbations.},

  year = {2000},
  journal = {Geological Society of America Bulletin},
  pages = {18},
  abstract = {Improved formulation of bedrock erosion laws requires knowledge of the actual processes operative at the bed. We present qualitative field evidence from a wide range of settings that the relative efficacy of the various processes of fluvial erosion (e.g., plucking, abrasion, cavitation, solution) is a strong function of substrate lithology, and that joint spacing, fractures, and bedding planes exert the most direct control. The relative importance of the various processes and the nature of the interplay between them are inferred from detailed observations of the morphology of erosional forms on channel bed and banks, and their spatial distributions. We find that plucking dominates wherever rocks are well jointed on a submeter scale. Hydraulic wedging of small clasts into cracks, bashing and abrasion by bedload, and chemical and physical weathering all contribute to the loosening and removal of joint blocks. In more massive rocks, abrasion by suspended sand appears to be rate limiting in the systems studied here. Concentration of erosion on downstream sides of obstacles and tight coupling between fluid-flow patterns and fine-scale morphology of erosion forms testify to the importance of abrasion by suspended-load, rather than bedload, particles. Mechanical analyses indicate that erosion by suspended-load abrasion is considerably more nonlinear in shear stress than erosion by plucking. In addition, a new analysis indicates that cavitation is more likely to occur in natural systems than previously argued. Cavitation must be considered a viable process in many actively incising bedrock channels and may contribute to the fluting and potholing of massive, unjointed rocks that is otherwise attributed to suspended-load abrasion. Direct field evidence of cavitation erosion is, however, lacking. In terms of the well-known shear-stress (or stream-power) erosion law, erosion by plucking is consistent with a slope exponent (n) of \textasciitilde 2/3 to 1, whereas erosion by suspended-load abrasion is more consistent with a slope exponent of \textasciitilde 5/3. Given that substrate lithology appears to dictate the dominant erosion process, this finding has important implications for long-term landscape evolution and the models used to study it.},

The resulting Trans-Hudson orogen was a collisional belt similar in scale to the modern Himalayas. It contains mainly reworked Archean crust, but remnants of juvenile volcanic belts are preserved between Archean masses.

A velocity\textendash strain formulation is used, which allows for the solution of the acoustic and elastic wave equations within the same unified framework. Careful attention is directed at the derivation of a numerical flux that preserves high-order accuracy in the presence of material discontinuities, including elastic\textendash acoustic interfaces. Explicit expressions for the 3D upwind numerical flux, derived as an exact solution for the relevant Riemann problem, are provided. The method supports h-non-conforming meshes, which are particularly effective at allowing local adaptation of the mesh size to resolve strong contrasts in the local wavelength, as well as dynamic adaptivity to track solution features. The use of high-order elements controls numerical dispersion, enabling propagation over many wave periods. We prove consistency and stability of the proposed dG scheme. To study the numerical accuracy and convergence of the proposed method, we compare against analytical solutions for wave propagation problems with interfaces, including Rayleigh, Lamb, Scholte, and Stoneley waves as well as plane waves impinging on an elastic\textendash acoustic interface. Spectral rates of convergence are demonstrated for these problems, which include a non-conforming mesh case. Finally, we present scalability results for a parallel implementation of the proposed high-order dG scheme for large-scale seismic wave propagation in a simplified earth model, demonstrating high parallel efficiency for strong scaling to the full size of the Jaguar Cray XT5 supercomputer.},

  pages = {5},
  abstract = {The dynamic system of tectonics and erosion contains important feedback mechanisms such that orogenic systems tend toward a steady state. This concept is often invoked, but the nature of the steady state is commonly not specified. We identify four types of steady state that characterize the orogenic system and illustrate these cases by using numerical-model results and natural examples. These types are (1) flux steady state, (2) topographic steady state, (3) thermal steady state, and (4) exhumational steady state: they refer to the erosional flux, the topography, the subsurface temperature field, and the spatial pattern of cooling ages, respectively. Models suggest that the topography will reach a steady mean form at the scale of an orogenic belt, but perfect topographic steady state is unlikely to be achieved at shorter length scales. Thermal steady state is a precondition for exhumational steady state and in the case of temperature-dependent deformation, topographic steady state. Exhumational steady state is characterized by reset age zones spatially nested according to closure temperature, as illustrated in natural systems from New Zealand, the Cascadia accretionary margin, and Taiwan.},

  abstract = {New structural-stratigraphical mapping constrains the three-dimensional kinematics and mechanisms of Eocendligocene growth folding at Sant Llorenp de Morunys (NE Ebro basin, Spain). A 1 km wide sub-vertical pane1 of syntectonic alluvial gravels passes southwards via a highly asymmetrical growth fold-pair to shallowlydipping strata. The axial surface of the anticline comprises either continuous or en bchelon segments while that of the syncline is concave and usually continuous. While converging upwards, the axial surfaces do not define growth triangles. Principal and subsidiary growth unconformities and thickness changes occur across both axial surfaces and the common limb. Dips within the common limb decrease up-stratigraphy and up-dip. Mesostructures indicate that internal deformation was ongoing during folding at all stratigraphical levels, and concentration of cleavage in the syncline indicates that this hinge was essentially fixed. Sequential restoration of three profiles shows that folds amplified principally by limb rotation but incorporated minor passive hinge migration. Particle movement vectors, generated by section restoration, are arcuate about a hinterland pinpoint. A new trishear mode1 of fault propagation folding involving non-rigid limb rotation reproduces the rounded hinge forms, thickening geometries and limb dip variations observed. Simple kink band migration models (fixed axis and constant thickness theories) do not replicate these features. 0 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The 0.76 Ma Bishop Tuff, from Long Valley caldera in eastern California, consists of a widespread fall deposit and voluminous partly welded ignimbrite. The fall deposit (F), exposed over an easterly sector below and adjacent to the ignimbrite, is divided into nine units (F1\textendash F9), with no significant time breaks, except possibly between F8 and F9. Maximum clast sizes are compared with other deposits where accumulation rates are known or inferred to estimate an accumulation time for F1\textendash F8 as ca. 90 hrs. The ignimbrite (Ig) is divided into chronologically and/or geographically distinct packages of material. Earlier packages (Ig1) were emplaced mostly eastward, are wholly intraplinian (coeval with fall units F2\textendash F8), lack phenocrystic pyroxenes, and contain few or no Glass Mountain-derived rhyolite lithic fragments. Later packages (Ig2) were erupted mostly to the north and east, are at least partly intraplinian (interbedded with fall unit F9 to the east), contain pyroxenes, and have lithic fractions rich in Glass Mountain-derived rhyolite or other lithologies exposed on the northern caldera rim. Recognition of the intraplinian nature of Ig1 east of the caldera and use of the fall deposit chronometry yields accumulation estimates of ca. 25 hrs for an earlier, less-welded subpackage and ca. 36 hrs for a later, mostly welded subpackage. Average accumulation rates range up to Ն1 mm/s of densewelded massive ignimbrite, equivalent to Ն2.5 mm/s of non-welded material. Comparisons of internal stratification in Ig1 and northern Ig2 lobes suggest the thickest northern ignimbrite accumulated in Յ35 hrs. Identifiable vent positions migrated from an initial site previously proposed in the south-central part of the caldera (F1\textendash 8, Ig1) in complex fashion; one vent set (for eastern Ig2) migrated east and north toward Glass Mountain, while another set (for northern Ig2) opened from west to east across the northern caldera margin. Vent locations for Ig1 and Ig2 southwest of the caldera have not been identified. The new stratigraphic framework shows that much of the Bishop ignimbrite is intraplinian in nature, and that fall deposits and ignimbrite units previously inferred to be sequential are largely or wholly coeval. Fundamental reassessment is therefore required of all existing models for the eruption dynamics and the nature and causes of pre-eruptive zonations in trace elements, volatiles, and isotopes in the parental magma chamber.},

As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},

Palaeomagnetic and palaeofloral data indicate that early accretion (Vendian\textendash Ordovician) took place when Baltica and Siberia were separated by a wide ocean. Island arcs and Precambrian microcontinents accreted to the active margins of the two continents or amalgamated in an oceanic setting (as in Kazakhstan) by roll-back and collision, forming a huge accretionary collage. The Palaeo-Asian Ocean closed in the Permian with formation of the Solonker suture. We evaluate contrasting tectonic models for the evolution of the orogenic belt. Current information provides little support for the main tenets of the one- or three-arc Kipchak model; current data suggest that an archipelago-type (Indonesian) model is more viable. Some diagnostic features of ridge\textendash trench interaction are present in the Central Asian orogen (e.g. granites, adakites, boninites, near-trench magmatism, Alaskan-type mafic\textendash ultramafic complexes, high-temperature metamorphic belts that prograde rapidly from low-grade belts, rhyolitic ash-fall tuffs).

The latter has been one of the most seismically active intracontinental regions of the world in this century. The occurrences of earthquakes are mostly controlled by active faults. The relief in the area is remarkable due to its sharp contrasts and the multitude and variability of the morphological elements: high rugged mountains, basins, and wide hilly areas composed of loose sands, gravels and boulders. In an area such as this, where the morphology of the terrain responds to a cold, dry climate and where erosion is slow, fault ruptures cutting pediment surfaces are well preserved. Various geomorphic features supporting recent tectonic movements were deciphered from the various remotely sensed data. These include: strike-slip faults, fault line scarps, triangular facets, uphill facing scarps, pressure-ridges, abrupt change in topographic slope angles along fault traces, offset drainage, truncated fan and beheaded drainage. Most of these features were examined in the field and revealed movements that have occurred during the Holocene (past 10,000 years).},

The eastern cover sequence is dominated by metamorphosed graywacke, siltstone, shale, and mafic volcanics and unconformably overlies the basement rocks along the eastern margin and in the northern interior of the massif. The western boundary of the massif, south of Clarendon, Vermont, is an unconformity between Middle Proterozoic basement and western cover sequence rocks composed of metamorphosed conglomerate, quartz-sandstone, dolomite, and limestone. The western boundary, north of Clarendon, however, is a thrust which carried Grenville basement and eastern cover rocks over the western cover sequence. The structural interpretation of these basement-cover contacts and the contrast in lithology and inferred depositional environment of the western and eastern cover sequences indicate that the Green Mountain massif consists of two different tectonic units. A structurally higher, more highly-transported unit is composed of Middle Proterozoic basement rocks unconformably overlain by the eastern cover sequence, and a relatively less transported unit occupying the southwest part of the massif is composed of Middle Proterozoic basement rocks unconformably overlain by the western cover sequence.},

Maximum vertical and horizontal offsets of 6.5 m and 4.9 m, respectively, were measured along the Beichuan fault. A maximum vertical offset of 3.5 m was measured along the Pengguan fault. Coseismic surface ruptures, integrated with aftershocks and industry seismic profiles, show that two imbricate structures have ruptured simultaneously, resulting in the largest continental thrust event ever documented.

The Longmenshan margin of the Tibetan Plateau is a steep, 4 km topographic front situated near the boundaries between westerlies and Asian monsoon moisture sources, and is previously unexplored with respect to the variation in water isotopic composition with elevation. This study reports stable isotope data from 101 water samples collected from streams, springs, and ponds along the Min River (Minjiang) watershed, which traverses the Longmenshan margin. Local meteoric water lines, d-excess values, and surrounding precipitation and river water data sets suggest that precipitation across the Longmenshan margin is dominated by the East Asian summer monsoon. The increase in d-excess values with increasing catchment elevation breaks down as local moisture recycling becomes important at elevations {$>$} 3 km a.s.l.. Along the Min River, however, the d18Ow and dDw values decrease with increasing catchment elevation, which fit second-order polynomial curves and are well-approximated by a simple Rayleigh fractionation processes. The temperature-corrected oxygen values in authigenic carbonates from the Pleistocene Zoige Basin, north of the Min River watershed, yield elevations equivalent to present by the oxygen isotope-elevation relationship of the Longmenshan margin.},

Our model showed that the dynamic rupture front propagated eastward from the hypocenter at 3.0 km/s and triggered a large-slip event centered about 50 km to the east. It also showed that the large-slip event included a rapid rupture acceleration event and an irregular deceleration of rupture propagation before the rupture termination. Heterogeneity of the stress drop or fracture energy in the eastern part of the rupture area, where aftershock activity was high, inhibited rupture growth. High-frequency radiation sources tended to be in the deeper part of the large-slip area, which suggests that heterogeneity of the stress drop or fracture energy there may have contributed to the damage in and around Kathmandu.},

Results show a \textasciitilde 30\% deficit between original and modern orogen volumes if the average global crustal thickness of 41 km is assumed prior to collision, even once eastward extrusion and crustal flow are considered. Such a large discrepancy requires crustal recycling of a magnitude that is greater than one half of the modern orogenic mass, as others have previously suggested. Proposals for extensive high elevations prior to or soon after the collision further exacerbate this mismatch and dramatically increase the volume of material necessary to be placed into the mantle. However, we show that this discrepancy can be eliminated with a 23\textendash 29 km thick crust within the orogen prior to collision along with a thick southern Tibet margin (the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes). Because of the relatively low magnitude of surface shortening in Asia, an initially thin crust would require underplating of Indian crust in southern Tibet and displacement of a highly mobile lower crust to the north and east in order to explain modern crustal thicknesses. The contrast between a proposed thinner Asian interior and older and thicker lithosphere of the North China block may have defined the distal extent of deformation at the time of collision and since.},

  abstract = {We introduce AdaHessian, a second order stochastic optimization algorithm which dynamically incorporates the curvature of the loss function via ADAptive estimates of the Hessian. Second order algorithms are among the most powerful optimization algorithms with superior convergence properties as compared to first order methods such as SGD and Adam. The main disadvantage of traditional second order methods is their heavier per-iteration computation and poor accuracy as compared to first order methods. To address these, we incorporate several novel approaches in AdaHessian, including: (i) a fast Hutchinson based method to approximate the curvature matrix with low computational overhead; (ii) a root-mean-square exponential moving average to smooth out variations of the Hessian diagonal across different iterations; and (iii) a block diagonal averaging to reduce the variance of Hessian diagonal elements. We show that AdaHessian achieves new state-of-the-art results by a large margin as compared to other adaptive optimization methods, including variants of Adam. In particular, we perform extensive tests on CV, NLP, and recommendation system tasks and find that AdaHessian: (i) achieves 1.80\%/1.45\% higher accuracy on ResNets20/32 on Cifar10, and 5.55\% higher accuracy on ImageNet as compared to Adam; (ii) outperforms AdamW for transformers by 0.13/0.33 BLEU score on IWSLT14/WMT14 and 2.7/1.0 PPL on PTB/Wikitext-103; (iii) outperforms AdamW for SqueezeBert by 0.41 points on GLUE; and (iv) achieves 0.032\% better score than Adagrad for DLRM on the Criteo Ad Kaggle dataset. Importantly, we show that the cost per iteration of AdaHessian is comparable to first-order methods, and that it exhibits robustness towards its hyperparameters. The code for AdaHessian is open-sourced and publicly-available [1].},

PYHESSIAN enables fast computations of the top Hessian eigenvalues, the Hessian trace, and the full Hessian eigenvalue/spectral density, and it supports distributed-memory execution on cloud/supercomputer systems and is available as open source [1]. This general framework can be used to analyze neural network models, including the topology of the loss landscape (i.e., curvature information) to gain insight into the behavior of different models/optimizers. To illustrate this, we analyze the effect of residual connections and Batch Normalization layers on the trainability of neural networks. One recent claim, based on simpler first-order analysis, is that residual connections and Batch Normalization make the loss landscape ``smoother'', thus making it easier for Stochastic Gradient Descent to converge to a good solution. Our extensive analysis shows new finer-scale insights, demonstrating that, while conventional wisdom is sometimes validated, in other cases it is simply incorrect. In particular, we find that Batch Normalization does not necessarily make the loss landscape smoother, especially for shallower networks.},

The folded structures of the Lake zone host basalt, basalt\textendash andesite, and andesite complexes of volcanic rocks that were formed in distinct geodynamic environments. The volcanic rocks of the basalt complex are noted for high concentrations of TiO2 and alkalis, occur in association with fine grained siliceous siltstone and siliceous\textendash carbonate rocks, are thus close to oceanic island complexes, and were likely formed in relation to a mantle hotspot activity far away from erosion regions supplying terrig enous material. The rocks of the basalt\textendash andesite and andesite complexes have lower TiO2 concentrations and moderate concentrations of alkalis and contain rock forming amphibole. These rocks are accompanied by rudaceous terrigenous sediments, which suggests their origin in island arc environments, including arcs with a significantly dissected topography. These complexes are accompanied by siliceous\textendash terrigenous sedimen tary sequences whose inner structure is close to those of sediments in accretionary wedges. The folded Cale donides of the Lake zone passed through the following evolutionary phases. The island arcs started to develop at 570 Ma, their evolution was associated with the emplacement of layered gabbroids and tonalite\textendash trondhjemite massifs, and continued until the onset of accretion at 515\textendash 480 Ma. The accretion was accom panied by the emplacement of large massifs of the tonalite\textendash granodiorite\textendash plagiogranite series. The postac cretionary evolutionary phase at 470\textendash 440 Ma of the Caledonides was marked by intrusive subalkaline and alkaline magmatism. The Caledonides are characterized by within plate magmatic activity throughout their whole evolutionary history, a fact explained by the accretion of Vendian\textendash Cambrian oceanic structures (island arcs, oceanic islands, and back arc basins) above a mantle hotspot. Indicators of within plate magmatic activity are subalkaline high Ti basalts, alkaline\textendash ultrabasic complexes with carbonatites and massifs of sub alkaline and alkaline gabbroids, nepheline syenites, alkaline granites, subalkaline granites, and granosyenites. The mantle hotspot likely continued to affect the character of the lithospheric magmatism even after the Caledonian folded terrane was formed.},

In this paper, we modify their approach, improving the stability of the scheme and extending its range of applicability.

  abstract = {We present a new method for the solution of the unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Our goal is to achieve a robust and scalable methodology for two and three dimensional incompressible flows. The discretization of the Navier-Stokes operator is done using boundary integrals and structured-grid finite elements. We use finite-differences to advance the equations in time. The convective term is discretized via a semi-Lagrangian formulation which not only results in a spatial constant-coefficient (modified) Stokes operator, but in addition is unconditionally stable. The Stokes operator is inverted by a double-layer boundary integral formulation. Domain integrals are computed via finite elements with appropriate forcing singularities to account for the irregular geometry. We use a velocity-pressure formulation which we discretize with bilinear elements (Q1-Q1), which give equal order interpolation for the velocities and pressures. Stabilization is used to circumvent the div-stability condition for the pressure space. The integral equations are discretized by Nystro\textasciidieresis m's method. For the specific approximation choices the method is second order accurate. Our code is built on top of PETSc, an MPI based parallel linear algebra library. We will present numerical results and discuss the performance and scalability of the method in two dimensions.},

The main feature of our algorithm is that it does not require the implementation of multipole expansions of the underlying kernel, and it is based only on kernel evaluations. Instead of using analytic expansions to represent the potential generated by sources inside a box of the hierarchical FMM tree, we use a continuous distribution of an equivalent density on a surface enclosing the box. To find this equivalent density we match its potential to the potential of the original sources at a surface, in the far field, by solving local Dirichlet-type boundary value problems. The far field evaluations are sparsified with singular value decomposition in 2D or fast Fourier transforms in 3D. We have tested the new method on the single and double layer operators for the Laplacian, the modified Laplacian, the Stokes, the modified Stokes, the Navier, and the modified Navier operators in two and three dimensions. Our numerical results indicate that our method compares very well with the best known implementations of the analytic FMM method for both the Laplacian and modified Laplacian kernels. Its advantage is the (relative) simplicity of the implementation and its immediate extension to more general kernels.},

The current N-body solver uses a fast multipole method with an efficient strategy for finding the list of cell-cell interactions by a dual tree traversal. A task-based threading model is used to maximize thread-level parallelism and intra-node load-balancing. In order to extract the full potential of the SIMD units on the latest CPUs, the inner kernels are optimized using AVX instructions.},

The simulations use a vortex particle method to solve the Navier-Stokes equations, with a highly parallel fast multipole method (fmm) as numerical engine, and match the current record in mesh size for this application, a cube of 40963 computational points solved with a spectral method. The standard numerical approach used in this field is the pseudo-spectral method, relying on the fft algorithm as numerical engine. The particle-based simulations presented in this paper quantitatively match the kinetic energy spectrum obtained with a pseudo-spectral method, using a trusted code. In terms of parallel performance, weak scaling results show the fmm-based vortex method achieving 74\% parallel efficiency on 4096 processes (one gpu per mpi process, 3 gpus per node of the tsubame-2.0 system). The fft-based spectral method is able to achieve just 14\% parallel efficiency on the same number of mpi processes (using only cpu cores), due to the all-to-all communication pattern of the fft algorithm. The calculation time for one time step was 108 seconds for the vortex method and 154 seconds for the spectral method, under these conditions. Computing with 69 billion particles, this work exceeds by an order of magnitude the largest vortex-method calculations to date.},

For many applications, GOFMM enables an approximate matrix-vector multiplication in N log N or even N time, where N is the matrix size. Compression requires N log N storage and work. In general, our scheme belongs to the family of hierarchical matrix approximation methods. In particular, it generalizes the fast multipole method (FMM) to a purely algebraic setting by only requiring the ability to sample matrix entries. Neither geometric information (i.e., point coordinates) nor knowledge of how the matrix entries have been generated is required, thus the term ``geometry-oblivious.'' Also, we introduce a shared-memory parallel scheme for hierarchical matrix computations that reduces synchronization barriers. We present results on the Intel Knights Landing and Haswell architectures, and on the NVIDIA Pascal architecture for a variety of matrices.},

Our simulation results demonstrate that the first-order fault geometry heterogeneity, the transitionalsegment (possibly related to the subducting Scarborough seamount chain) connecting the steeper south segment and the flatter north segment, controls earthquake rupture behaviors. The strong along-strike curvature at the transitional-segment typically leads to partial ruptures of MW\textasciitilde 8.3 and MW\textasciitilde 7.8 along the southern and northern segments respectively. The entire fault occasionally ruptures in MW\textasciitilde 8.8 events when the cumulative stress in the transitional-segment is sufficiently high to overcome the geometrical inhibition. Fault shear stress evolution, represented by the S-ratio, is clearly modulated by the width of seismogenic zone (W). At a constant plate convergence rate, a larger W indicates on average lower interseismic stress loading rate and longer rupture recurrence period, and could slow down or sometimes stop ruptures that initiated from a narrower portion. Moreover, the modeled interseismic slip rate before whole-fault rupture events is comparable with the coupling state that was inferred from the interplate seismicity distribution, suggesting the Manila trench could potentially rupture in a M8+ earthquake.},

Seismic tomography images of the upper mantle are used to determine the displacement of the downwelling ``tail'' by the background mantle flow. The ``mantle wind'' direction based on this analysis is estimated to be SSW, in contradiction to another recent estimate based on a combination of geodetic data and shear-wave splitting measurements. The conflicting conclusions can be reconciled if the splitting measurements are dominated by anisotropy in the shallow mantle imposed by lithospheric motion. The SSW direction is approximately consistent with global models of asthenospheric counterflow directions, and therefore supports the idea that self-driving plate forces can explain the absolute motion of the North American plate.},

H matrices approximate specific dense matrices, e.g., from discretized integral equations or kernel ridge regression, leading to log-linear time complexity in dense matrix-vector products. The parallelization of H matrix operations on many-core processors is difficult due to the complex nature of the underlying algorithms. While previous algorithmic advances for many-core hardware focused on accelerating existing H matrix CPU implementations by many-core processors, we here aim at totally relying on that processor type. As main contribution, we introduce the necessary parallel algorithmic patterns allowing to map the full H matrix construction and the fast matrix-vector product to many-core hardware. Here, crucial ingredients are space filling curves, parallel tree traversal and batching of linear algebra operations. The resulting model GPU implementation hmglib is the, to the best of the authors knowledge, first entirely GPU-based Open Source H matrix library of this kind. We conclude this work by an in-depth performance analysis and a comparative performance study against a standard H matrix library, highlighting profound speedups of our many-core parallel approach.},

It provides also economic operators for the multipole-tomultipole, multipole-to-local, and local-to-local translations that are typical and essential in the FMM algorithms. The multipole-to-local translation operator, in particular, is readily diagonal and does not dominate in arithmetic operations. FKI-FMM provides an alternative and competitive option, among other kernel-independent FMM algorithms, for an efficient application of the FMM, especially for applications where the kernel function consists of multi-physics and multi-scale components as those arising in recent studies of biological systems.

  abstract = {GPS displacement vectors show that the crust in east Tibet is being squeezed in an easterly direction by the northward motion of the Indian plate, and the Sichuan Basin is resisting this stream and redirecting it mainly towards Indochina. The Longmen Shan, containing the steepest rise to the high plateau anywhere in Tibet, results from the strong interaction between the east Tibetan escape flow and the rigid Yangtze block (Sichuan Basin), but the kinematics and dynamics of this interaction are still the subject of some debates. We herein present results from a dense passive-source seismic profile from the Sichuan Basin into eastern Tibet in order to study the deep structure of this collision zone. Using P and S receiver function images we observe a sudden rise of the Lithosphere\textendash Asthenosphere Boundary (LAB) from 120 to 150 km beneath the Sichuan Basin and from 70 to 80 km beneath eastern Tibet. In contrast, the depth of the crust\textendash mantle boundary (Moho) increases from 36 to 40 km beneath the Sichuan Basin and from 55 to 60 km beneath eastern Tibet. The 410 km discontinuity is depressed below eastern Tibet by about 30 km, although the 660 remains at nearly the same depth throughout the LMS. From these observations, we conclude that the mode of collision that occurs between Tibet and the Sichuan Basin is very different to that found between India and Tibet. In southern Tibet, we observe in essence the subduction of the Indian plate, which penetrates northwards for several hundred kilometers under central Tibet. The very thin mantle part of the lithosphere beneath eastern Tibet may indicate delamination or removal of the bottom of the lithosphere by hot asthenospheric escape flow. This process leads to the exceptionally steep topography at the eastern Tibetan margin as a result of gravitational buoyancy. This view is supported by the very unusual depression of the 410 km discontinuity beneath eastern Tibet, which could be caused by the dynamics of the sub-vertical downward asthenospheric flow.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the adaptive cross approximation (ACA) algorithm to reduce memory and CPU time overhead in the method of moments (MoM) solution of surface integral equations. The present algorithm is purely algebraic; hence, its formulation and implementation are integral equation kernel (Green's function) independent. The algorithm starts with a multilevel partitioning of the computational domain. The interactions of well-separated partitioning clusters are accounted through a rankrevealing LU decomposition. The acceleration and memory savings of ACA come from the partial assembly of the rank-deficient interaction submatrices. It has been demonstrated that the ACA algorithm results in O(N logN ) complexity (where N is the number of unknowns) when applied to static and electrically small electromagnetic problems. In this paper the ACA algorithm is extended to electromagnetic compatibility-related problems of moderate electrical size. Specifically, the ACA algorithm is used to study compact-range ground planes and electromagnetic interference and shielding in vehicles. Through numerical experiments, it is concluded that for moderate electrical size problems the memory and CPU time requirements for the ACA algorithm scale as N 4/3logN .},

  abstract = {The Longmenshan forms the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau adjacent to the Sichuan Basin. This range is anomalous because it formed despite low convergence and slip rates and without the development of a foreland basin. The devastating A.D. 2008 Wenchuan earthquake (Mw = 7.9) has renewed debate about the tectonics of the Longmenshan. A magnetotelluric (MT) study was undertaken subsequent to the earthquake to investigate the crustal structure of the Longmenshan, and inversion of the data reveals a low-resistivity (high-conductivity) layer at a depth of \textasciitilde 20 km beneath the eastern Tibetan Plateau that terminates \textasciitilde 25 km west of the Wenchuan-Maoxian fault. Its electrical properties are consistent with it being fluid-rich and mechanically weak. Beneath the Longmenshan and Sichuan Basin, a high-resistivity zone extends through the entire crust, but with a zone of low resistivity in the vicinity of the Wenchuan hypocenter. We show that the MT data, combined with other geological and geophysical observations, support geodynamic models for the uplift of eastern Tibet being caused by southeast-directed crustal flow that is blocked by stable lithosphere beneath the Sichuan Basin and Longmenshan, leading to inflation of the Songpan-Ganzi terrane. This rigid high-resistivity backstop not only provided a block to flow, but also may have accumulated stress prior to the earthquake. The MT observations provide new insights into the generation of the Wenchuan earthquake, which occurred in a region with low convergence rates prior to the earthquake.},

  abstract = {Studies of Late Quaternary geological slip-rates and the GPS decadal slip-rates along the major strike-slip faults in the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau show that slip-rates remain relatively constant along the middle sections of each fault and decrease rapidly toward the ends. Our recent studies suggest that the slip rates are low (b10 mm/yr) along the major strike-slip faults, i.e., Altyn-Tagh fault and Qilian-Haiyuan fault. West of 95\textdegree E, the slip rate on the Altyn-Tagh fault has been determined to be 8\textendash 12 mm/yr, and gradually decreases from 95\textdegree E eastward to about 1\textendash 2 mm/yr at the easternmost segment of the fault. The slip-rate of Qilian-Haiyuan fault is about 1\textendash 2 mm/yr near the Halahu Lake, near the western tip of the fault, then increases to a relatively constant value of 4\textendash 5 mm/yr in the Qilian area (101\textdegree E and eastward). Eastward, the fault merges into the NS trending Liupan Shan fault zone east of Haiyuan, and the slip rate drops to 1\textendash 3 mm/yr, or even lower. Our present observations on the variation and distribution of slip rates along the major strike slip faults indicate that slip on the Altyn-Tagh fault is mainly dissipated through internal deformation, by thrust faulting within the Qilian Shan and shortening within the adjacent Cenozoic basins. Leftlateral strike-slip on the Qilian-Haiyuan fault might be transformed into shortening and growth of the Liupan Shan to the east, and may also contribute partially to the deformation in the western Qilian Shan. In conclusion, the distribution of slip rates from both late Quaternary geological records and the current GPS observations suggest a decrease in slip rate, a redistribution of strain, and the transformation of displacement along the major strike slip faults into crustal shortening, basin formation and mountain uplift that characterize present-day deformation of the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau.},

We propose that due to modulation of continents, these two modes of mantle convection alternate within the Earth's mantle, causing the cyclic processes of assembly and breakup of supercontinents including Rodinia and Pangea in the last 1 Ga. Our model suggests that the largely degree-2 structure for the present-day mantle with the Africa and Pacific antipodal superplumes, is a natural consequence of this dynamic process of very long-wavelength mantle convection interacting with supercontinent Pangea. Our model explains the basic features of true polar wander (TPW) events for Rodinia and Pangea including their equatorial locations and large variability of TPW inferred from paleomagnetic studies. Our model also suggests that TPW is expected to be more variable and large during supercontinent assembly, but small after a supercontinent acquires its equatorial location and during its subsequent dispersal.},

By appropriate use of auxiliary line and/or fictitious points, physical jump conditions are enforced at the interface. Unlike other existing interface schemes, the proposed method disassociates the enforcement of physical jump conditions from the discretization of the differential equation under study. To construct higher order interface schemes, the proposed MIB method bypasses the major challenge of implementing high order jump conditions by repeatedly enforcing the lowest order jump conditions. The proposed MIB method is of arbitrarily high order, in principle. In treating straight, regular interfaces we construct MIB schemes up to 16th-order. For more general elliptic problems with curved, irregular interfaces and boundary, up to 6th-order MIB schemes have been demonstrated. By employing the standard high-order finite difference schemes to discretize the Laplacian, the present MIB method automatically reduces to the standard central difference scheme when the interface is absent. The immersed interface method (IIM) is regenerated for a comparison study of the proposed method. The robustness of the MIB method is verified against the large magnitude of the jump discontinuity across the interface. The nature of high efficiency and low memory requirement of the MIB method is extensively validated via solving various elliptic immersed interface problems in two- and three-dimensions.},

The goal is to evaluate layer potentials close to the boundary over which they are defined. The approach introduced here converts these nearly-singular integrals on a patch of the boundary to a set of non-singular line integrals on the patch boundary using the Stokes theorem on manifolds. A function approximation scheme based on harmonic polynomials is designed to express the integrand in a form that is suitable for applying the Stokes theorem. As long as the data\textemdash the boundary and the density function\textemdash is given in a high-order format, the double-layer potential and its derivatives can be evaluated with high-order accuracy using this scheme both on and off the boundary. In particular, we present numerical results demonstrating seventh-order convergence on a smooth, warped torus example achieving 10-digit accuracy in evaluating double layer potential at targets that are arbitrarily close to the boundary.},

Even if detailed earthquake information from some centuries including historic and paleoearthquakes are given, only very few, namely the largest events, will contribute at all to the estimation of mmax, and this results in unacceptably high uncertainties.

Geological, petrochemical and geochemical data indicate that the ultramafics are turn off from the overlying ophiolitic sequence. Igneous rocks of the ophiolitic complex, except the ultramafics, were formed by two-stage differentiation of mantle magma of quartz-tholeiitic composition exhausted in potassium and titanium. Pyroxenites and gabbro with an anorthositic trend of differentiation were generated during the first stage, and sheeted dikes and pillow lavas with a quartz trend of differentiation were formed during the second one. Ophiolites of the Khan-Taishir complex petrochemically and geochemically differ strongly from mafic and ultramafic rocks of midoceanic ridges. Together with ophiolites of the Troodos complex (Cyprus) and Macquarie Island (eastern Indian Ocean) they constitute the special type of ophiolite peculiar rather to slip boundaries of lithosphere plates. The other type of ophiolite, including complexes like the Dzolen complex of south Mongolia, contains poorly differentiated ultramafics and does not contain sheeted dikes; while the igneous rocks are very similar to mafic and ultramafic rocks dredged from midoceanic and formed probably in midoceanic ridge environments as well.},
