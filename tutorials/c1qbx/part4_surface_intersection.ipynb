    "# Modeling an infinite strike slip fault in an elastic half space\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal here is to reproduce the classical results for an antiplane fault as a screw dislocation in an elastic half space. This is a great test of a numerical boundary integral solver because it has several particularly difficult features:\n",
    "- **Infinite surfaces**: The free surface in the analytical solution is infinite. Numerical methods are normally very bad at infinity! The traditional solution to this is to use half-space Green's functions for a boundary integral method - effectively, this solves the problem analytically.\n",
    "- **The fault tip**: Constant slip on a finite fault will result in a stress singularity at the bottom tip of the fault. This results from the infinitesimal jump from non-zero slip on the fault side of the fault tip to zero slip on the non-fault side of the fault tip. Or, from a calculus perspective, $\\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial y} = \\lim_{\\Delta y \\to 0} \\frac{\\Delta u_z}{\\Delta y}$. At the fault tip, $\\Delta u_z$ remains constant as $\\Delta y$ converges to zero. The result is that the limit is infinite.\n",
    "- **The fault-surface intersection**: Considering either surface alone, there will be another singularity at the fault-surface intersection for the same logic as the fault tip: for the free surface, there is a jump in the displacement across the fault and for the fault, there is effectively another fault tip. However, these singularities exactly cancel leaving an entirely regular displacement and stress solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to solve all these issues via a direct numerical solution. The methodology used here:\n",
    "1. Can model very long but not truly infinite surfaces.\n",
    "2. Can calculate displacement and stress arbitrarily close a singularity."

In this case, the integral of $\\frac{\\partial G(x,y)}{\\partial y}$ is also known as the \"double layer\" potential in classical potential theory because it represents the effect of two co-located sheets of oppositely charged particles. Beyond the mathematical correspondence, this also maps nicely in a conceptual sense to our setting: the double layer potential represents the effect of a jump in displacement across a surface (the fault!).\n",
    "2. The observation points. Since we want to calculate the displacement at the free surface, we pass the nodes of the free surface mesh as the observation points: `free.pts`. Note that because these points are on the boundary of the domain, the integrals are computed as limits to the boundary $\\hat{x} \\to x$.\n",
    "3. A flexible number of source surfaces. The numerical integration is much easier if we can handle all the relevant surfaces at once in the form of the original governing equation before we had separated the free surface and fault. `integrate_term` will automatically separate the subcomponents of the resulting matrix\n",
    "4. The direction for any limits to the boundary. In this case, we want to approach the boundary from the interior, so we pass `limit_direction=1.0`. If we had wanted to approach the boundary from the exterior, we could pass `limit_direction=-1.0`.\n",

    "\n",
    "The model has stress singularities. This is generally a sign that you should reconsider your modeling choices, but in this case it's okay because we're trying to match an existing analytical solution. Computing integrals near singularities in the solution is quite difficult. However, `integrate_term` will do its best to handle those singularities. For optimal accuracy, you can specify the location of the singularities. Preferably, we will also specify the location of any \"possible singularities\" as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a possible-singularities?** Any given point will only be a singularity for some choices of slip field.  For example, the fault tip will produce a stress singularity for any slip distribution that is non-zero at the tip. But, if the slip field happens to be exactly zero at the fault tip, then there is no singularity. This is uncertainty is irrelevant to the integration algorithm because the algorithm is producing a matrix that can be used for arbitrary slip distributions. So, to handle the general case, it's important to assume that any \"possible singularity\" will be an actual singularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, there is a possible-singularity that turns out not to be a singularity: the fault-surface intersection. Here, either the step function in the surface displacement or the nonzero fault tip slip would cause a stress singularity on its own. But, when combined the singularities produced by these two features exactly cancel, leaving behind an entirely non-singular displacement field."

    "- `p_all`: This shows the QBX expansion order used for each interior point. The dark blue indicates zero expansion order which means that QBX was not used for those points.\n",
    "- `n_subsets`: The shows the number of adaptive integration steps that were taken in accurately integrating the QBX expansions. For example, if the integration interval `[-1, 1]` is split into three subsets: `[-1, 0], [0, 0.5], [0.5, 1]`, then `n_subsets = 3`.\n",
    "- `direction`: The shows the direction that the expansion center was offset from the nearby source surface with respect to the nearest source surface normal vector. So, `direction = 1` indicates that the expansion center for that observation is offset in the direction of the normal and `direction = -1` indicates that the expansion center was offset in the direction opposite the normal vector.\n",
    "- `on_surface`: This field is equal to 1 if the point is lying exactly on the nearest source surface.\n",
